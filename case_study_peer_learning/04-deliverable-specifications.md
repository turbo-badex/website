- Reinforce protocol during toolbox talks
- Distribute job aids and ensure accessibility
- Model protocol adherence (lead by example)
- Support crew if suspicious object is encountered

---

**Pre-Training: Your Responsibilities**

1. **Assign training in LMS**
   - Verify all crew members assigned
   - Set clear deadline (before site access or within first week)
   - Communicate importance: "This is safety-critical, not just compliance"

2. **Provide time during work hours**
   - Allow 30 minutes during shift (20 min training + buffer)
   - Mobile-friendly (can do on phone if no computer access)
   - Quiet space if possible (focus = better retention)

3. **Emphasize importance**
   - "This training could save your life"
   - "UXO risks are real on DND sites"
   - "Protocol protects you, the crew, and the public"

---

**Toolbox Talk Script (5 minutes)**

**Use this script during weekly safety meetings to reinforce UXO protocol:**

**Opening:**
"Quick safety reminder: UXO Awareness Protocol. If you haven't completed the online training yet, you need to finish it by [DATE]. For those who have, let's review the key points."

**Body:**
"We're working on a Department of National Defence site. There's potential for unexploded ordnance—military munitions that didn't detonate—buried in the ground from historical activities.

If you encounter anything suspicious during excavation or ground disturbance—unusual metal objects, military-looking items, anything you can't identify—here's exactly what you do:"

**The 4 Steps:**

"**1. STOP WORK immediately.**
- Halt all equipment. Turn it off.
- Alert your crew: 'Stop work! Suspicious object!'
- Move away from the object. Don't touch it, don't take photos up close, don't approach it.

**2. SECURE the area.**
- Establish a 25-meter exclusion zone—that's about 80 feet or 30-35 adult steps.
- Mark it with cones, tape, barriers—whatever you have.
- Keep everyone out. No exceptions.

**3. REPORT through the chain.**
- Workers: Tell me (your supervisor) immediately. Give me location, description, time.
- I'll notify site authority, who contacts the DCC Project Manager, who calls in the UXO experts.

**4. WAIT for clearance.**
- Only a qualified UXO disposal expert can assess the object.
- Only site authority can give the all-clear to resume work.
- We don't resume until we're told it's safe."

**Closing:**
"Your job aid has all this info—it's [posted at site office / in your welcome packet / available on your phone]. Keep it accessible.

Questions? [Pause for questions. Answer or escalate to DCC Environmental Services if unsure.]

Remember: When in doubt, stop work. Better safe than sorry. Your safety is the priority. Let's have a safe shift."

**Duration:** ~5 minutes

---

**If a Suspicious Object is Found: Your Immediate Actions**

**1. Immediate Response (First 5 minutes):**
- ✅ Verify work has stopped (all equipment off, all personnel stopped)
- ✅ Verify area is secured (25m exclusion zone marked, no one inside)
- ✅ Account for all crew (headcount, everyone safe and accounted for)
- ✅ Notify site authority (follow reporting chain immediately)
- ✅ Keep calm, keep crew calm (protocol is working, everyone is safe)

**2. Documentation (Within 30 minutes):**
- **Location:** GPS coordinates if available, or detailed description (near [landmark], [distance] from [reference point])
- **Description:** Size, shape, color, visible features—observed from safe distance (do NOT approach)
- **Time of discovery:** Date and time
- **Personnel involved:** Who found it, who was in area, who secured it
- **Actions taken:** Timeline of stop-work, area security, notification

**3. Communication (Ongoing):**
- **Notify DCC Project Manager:** Provide all documentation
- **Request UXO expert:** Through DCC PM (they coordinate expert response)
- **Update crew regularly:**
  - "Expert is en route, ETA [time]"
  - "Expert is assessing now"
  - "Site cleared, safe to resume" or "Object confirmed UXO, disposal in progress"
- **Manage expectations:** Expert arrival can take 2-24 hours depending on location

**4. Follow-Up (After incident):**
- **Debrief with crew:** Review what happened, reinforce good protocol adherence
- **Recognize positive behavior:** "Great job stopping immediately. That's exactly right."
- **Document incident report:** File with DCC safety team
- **Report protocol deviations:** If anyone violated protocol (touched object, entered zone, etc.), report to safety team for training follow-up

- By site (identify low-performing sites)
- By contractor (identify support needs)

**Action if <90%:**
- Investigate barriers (technical issues? time? motivation?)
- Increase reminders
- Manager escalation
- Remove site access until completed

---

### 5.2 Assessment Performance

**Metric 1:** Percentage of users who pass assessment (≥80% score)

**Target:** ≥90% pass rate (on first or subsequent attempts)

**Rationale:** Content designed for comprehension, unlimited attempts, mastery-based

**Data Source:** LMS quiz results

**Metric 2:** Average assessment score

**Target:** ≥85% average score

**Rationale:** Indicates content clarity and retention

**Data Source:** LMS quiz analytics

**Frequency:** Weekly during rollout, monthly ongoing

**Segmentation:**

- By experience level (if tracked)
- By attempts (first attempt vs after retry)

**Analysis:**
- Most-missed questions (identify content gaps)
- Critical item performance (must be 100%)
- Score distribution (bell curve vs bimodal)

**Action if <90% pass rate or <85% average:**
- Review most-missed questions
  - Is wording unclear?
  - Is content inadequately covered?
  - Is question too difficult/tricky?
- Revise content or quiz questions
- Provide additional support (study guide, review session)

---

### 5.3 Confidence & Satisfaction

**Metric 1:** Pre/post confidence ratings

**Question (pre-training):** "How confident are you in recognizing and responding to UXO?"
**Question (post-training):** "How confident are you in applying the UXO stop-work protocol?"

**Scale:** 1 (Not confident) to 5 (Very confident)

**Target:** +1.5 point increase (e.g., 2.5 → 4.0)

**Data Source:** Pre-survey (Screen 1.1) + Post-survey (after assessment)

**Metric 2:** Satisfaction rating

**Question:** "This training was clear, practical, and valuable."

**Scale:** 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree)

**Target:** ≥4.0 average

**Data Source:** End-of-module survey (2-question micro-survey)

**Frequency:** Collected from all completers, analyzed weekly

**Action if <4.0 satisfaction:**
- Review qualitative feedback (open-ended comments)
- Identify pain points (too long? confusing? not relevant?)
- Iterate module design

---

### 5.4 Time-on-Task

**Metric:** Average time to complete training module

**Target:** 15-20 minutes (design specification)

**Acceptable range:** 12-25 minutes

**Data Source:** LMS analytics (time from launch to completion)

**Frequency:** Weekly during rollout

**Analysis:**
- If significantly shorter (<12 min): Are learners rushing? Skipping content?
- If significantly longer (>25 min): Is content too dense? Technical issues causing delays?

**Segmentation:**

**Target:** 100% stop-work compliance

**Measurement:**
- Did worker stop work immediately?
- Was 25m exclusion zone established?
- Was reporting chain followed correctly?
- Were prohibited actions avoided (no touching, no approaching)?

**Frequency:** Post-incident analysis (every occurrence)

**Timeline:** 3-6 months post-training (real incidents may be infrequent)

**Metric 2:** Manager observations

**Data Source:** Manager checklist during site inspections

**Question:** "Is UXO job aid posted/accessible on site?"

**Target:** 100% sites have job aid visible/available

**Frequency:** Monthly site audits

**Metric 3:** Follow-up survey (30-90 days post-training)

**Questions:**
- "Have you encountered a suspicious object since training?" (Yes/No/Unsure)
- "If yes, did you follow the protocol?" (Yes/No—free text to describe)
- "Do you keep your job aid accessible?" (Yes/No)
- "Has the training changed how you approach ground disturbance work?" (Yes/No—free text)

**Target:** ≥80% report keeping job aid accessible

**Data Source:** Email survey to training completers

---

### 5.6 Business Results (Kirkpatrick Level 4)

**Metric 1:** Reduction in protocol deviations

**Baseline:** Establish current state (pre-training incidents)

**Target:** 50% reduction in deviations within 12 months

**Data Source:** Safety incident reports, near-miss reports

**Metric 2:** Faster reporting timelines

**Measurement:** Time from object discovery to expert notification

**Target:** Reduce average time by 30% (faster escalation through training awareness)

**Data Source:** Incident timestamps (discovery time → expert notification time)

**Metric 3:** Reduced site delays

**Measurement:** Downtime due to improper UXO handling (e.g., object moved, contamination spread)

**Target:** Zero delays due to protocol violations

**Data Source:** Project delay reports, incident analysis

**Metric 4:** Zero incidents from improper handling

**Target:** Zero injuries or detonations due to workers touching, moving, or approaching UXO

**Data Source:** Safety incident reports
