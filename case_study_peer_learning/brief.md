## **Project Brief**

**Project title:** Stop Work. Secure the Area. Report. — UXO Awareness for Construction Teams

**Client/Business owner:** Defence Construction Canada (DCC), Environmental Services (supporting DND/CAF)

**Project type:** Microlearning module \+ performance-support job aid

**Delivery platform:** Articulate Rise 360 (SCORM/xAPI export if required)

### **1\) Background and context**

DCC-managed construction and maintenance activities on DND properties can involve ground disturbance (excavation, trenching, drilling, demolition). Some sites may present potential encounters with **unexploded ordnance (UXO)** or **munitions-like suspicious objects** due to historical training activities. In these situations, the priority is **worker safety**, **site security**, and **consistent stop-work and reporting behavior**.

### **2\) Business problem**

Site personnel and contractors may:

* Delay or fail to stop work promptly

* Approach/handle suspicious items

* Use inconsistent reporting steps

* Create documentation gaps that increase risk and schedule impacts

### **3\) Project goal**

Create a short, scenario-driven learning module and a simple job aid to ensure learners can **recognize a potentially suspicious object situation** and **apply the correct stop-work and reporting sequence**.

### **4\) Target audience**

Primary:

* Construction contractors and subcontractors working on DND sites

* Equipment operators, labourers, forepersons, site supervisors

Secondary:

* DCC project staff who oversee construction activities (PMs, site reps)

Audience characteristics (assumptions):

* Wide range of experience

* Many are mobile-first, limited time, prefer practical “what to do now” guidance

* Training must be clear, plain-language, and action-oriented

### **5\) Scope**

**In scope**

* High-level awareness: what UXO is (definition-level only), why it matters

* “Red flag” situations (ground disturbance, unusual objects)

* **Behavioral protocol**: stop work, isolate area, notify via chain

* Role-specific expectations (worker vs supervisor vs PM/site authority)

* Knowledge checks and scenario practice

* 1-page printable job aid

**Out of scope**

* Identifying specific ordnance types

* Technical details on handling, disarming, moving, or disposal

* Site-specific emergency response plans (refer out)

* Legal/regulatory deep dives (links/references allowed, but not taught in detail)

### **6\) Constraints & compliance**

* Safety-critical content: must be reviewed/approved by appropriate authority (SME \+ safety)

* Must not instruct learners on how to manipulate or neutralize UXO

* Bilingual requirement if requested (EN/FR) — assume EN for demo unless specified

* Accessibility: aim for WCAG-aligned practices (alt text, contrast, keyboard, readable structure)

* Privacy/security: no sensitive site details, no real incident specifics

### **7\) Key stakeholders and roles**

* **Project Sponsor:** DCC Environmental Services lead

* **SME(s):** UXO safety authority / DND site authority (or designated UXO contractor rep), HSE

* **Instructional Designer (you):** analysis/design/build in Rise; job aid; QA; stakeholder management

* **Approver(s):** Sponsor \+ SME \+ safety review \+ (optional) communications/branding

### **8\) Deliverables**

1. Rise 360 module (15–20 minutes)

2. 1-page job aid (PDF-ready)

3. Question bank (10–12 items) \+ answer key/rationale

4. Implementation package (SCORM/xAPI settings \+ short facilitator/rollout note)

### **9\) Success measures**

* **Completion rate** target (e.g., ≥ 90% assigned users)

* **Assessment**: post-quiz score (e.g., ≥ 80% average)

* **Confidence**: self-rating increase (1–2 quick items)

* **Field indicators (optional):** fewer protocol deviations; faster stop-work reporting
