# Case Study: UXO Awareness Training for Federal Construction Sites

**Client:** Federal Government Agency – Environmental Services Division
**Project:** "Stop Work. Secure the Area. Report." – Safety-Critical UXO Protocol Training
**Role:** Lead Instructional Designer
**Duration:** 15-20 minute microlearning module + field job aid
**Audience:** 500-1000 construction workers, equipment operators, and site supervisors

## The Challenge

A federal government agency managing construction projects faced a critical safety challenge: construction workers on Department of National Defence (DND) sites could encounter unexploded ordnance (UXO) from historical military activities, but protocol adherence was inconsistent. Workers delayed stop-work responses, approached suspicious objects, or failed to report through proper channels—creating life-threatening risks.

The instructional challenge was equally complex:
- **Audience context:** Mobile-first construction workers with limited time, "just want to work" attitudes, and low intrinsic motivation for compliance training
- **Field environment:** Training had to work on smartphones in outdoor conditions with work gloves and frequent interruptions
- **Behavior change imperative:** The goal wasn't knowledge recall—it was immediate, accurate protocol execution in high-stress situations

## Solution & Design Approach

I applied a multi-framework instructional design approach integrating **ADDIE**, **Merrill's First Principles**, **Gagné's Nine Events**, and **Mayer's Multimedia Learning principles** to create a solution optimized for safety-critical behavior change.

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Scenario-Driven, Consequence-Based Learning**
Rather than lecture-based content, I designed three branching scenarios where learners face realistic decisions with visible consequences. Wrong choices—like continuing to dig or approaching an object—trigger consequence animations showing potential explosion risks, then provide immediate remediation. This safe failure environment teaches *why* the protocol matters, not just *what* it is.

**2. Microlearning Structure for Mobile-First Workers**
I chunked the training into five modules (3-7 minutes each) optimized for mobile completion:
- Module 1: Why it matters (real incident hook)
- Module 2: Recognition (red flags, image sorting practice)
- Module 3: Protocol (4 steps with worked example video)
- Module 4: Practice (branching scenarios)
- Module 5: Assessment + resources (10-question quiz, job aid download)

This structure respects workers' time constraints while maintaining engagement through high interactivity—every screen includes active learning elements.

**3. Assessment-First Design**
I designed the 10-question assessment before developing content, ensuring every learning objective directly supported behavioral readiness. Critical safety items (stop work immediately, 25m exclusion zone, reporting chain) required 100% accuracy to pass, while the overall threshold was 80%. Unlimited attempts with targeted remediation supported mastery-based learning.

**4. Performance Support at Point of Need**
Recognizing that training alone doesn't guarantee field application, I designed a 1-page laminated job aid as a performance support tool. The job aid features:
- High-contrast, color-coded protocol flowchart
- Plain language (Grade 6-8 reading level)
- Large text readable with work gloves in outdoor lighting
- Role-specific reporting chains
- Fillable emergency contact fields

**Technical Implementation:**
Rise 360 delivered SCORM-compliant, WCAG 2.1 AA accessible training with auto-save, offline capability, and responsive design. The package included LMS configuration guides, a 4-week rollout plan with pilot testing framework, manager support materials, and communication templates.

## Results & Impact

The solution was designed to achieve measurable behavior change across Kirkpatrick's four evaluation levels:

**Level 1 (Reaction):**
- ≥4.0/5.0 satisfaction rating
- +1.5 point confidence increase (pre/post survey)

**Level 2 (Learning):**
- ≥90% completion rate (mandatory, well-designed)
- ≥85% average assessment score
- 100% accuracy on critical safety items

**Level 3 (Behavior):**
- 100% protocol adherence in real UXO incidents
- Job aid accessible on 80%+ construction sites

**Level 4 (Results):**
- 50% reduction in protocol deviations year-over-year
- Zero injuries from improper UXO handling
- Faster expert response times (reduced reporting delays)

By combining evidence-based instructional design with mobile-first delivery and field-ready performance support, this solution transformed safety-critical protocol training from a compliance checkbox into a life-saving skill development experience scalable across 500-1000 annual users.
