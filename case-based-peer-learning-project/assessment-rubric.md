**Template provided:** Yes

### 2. Peer Contribution Observation (Collaborative) - 30%
**Assessed during:** Live sessions
**Method:** Facilitator observation + peer feedback survey

## Grading Scale

| Total Score | Grade | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| 90-100 | A | Exemplary case analysis + outstanding peer contribution |
| 80-89 | B | Proficient analysis + solid peer contribution |
| 70-79 | C | Developing analysis or weak peer contribution |
| Below 70 | Needs Improvement | Significant gaps in analysis or collaboration |

---

## Peer Feedback Survey (Anonymous)

**Rate 2 peers who contributed to your learning:**

1. [Peer Name] helped deepen my understanding by: _______
2. One strength they demonstrated: _______
3. One area for growth: _______

**Use these criteria:**
- Perspective Sharing
- Constructive Challenge
- Building on Ideas
- Professional Engagement

---

## Sample Excellent Recommendation Memo

**Strengths:**
- Clear recommendation in first paragraph
- Cites Exhibits A, B, C throughout
- Addresses Board, CIO, CFO concerns explicitly
- Quantitative reasoning (allocation percentages, cash flow)
- Implementation timeline with specific steps
- Risk mitigation section
- Honest about trade-offs ("This approach sacrifices X to gain Y")
- Integration of peer insights ("As discussed in stakeholder presentations...")

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Opinion without evidence:** "I think Option 2 is best" (no case data)
✅ **Evidence-based:** "Option 2 keeps allocation at 33% (Exhibit A) while preserving top-tier GP relationships"

❌ **Ignoring stakeholders:** Only considers own view
✅ **Multi-perspective:** "While the Board prioritizes policy compliance, the CIO's relationship concern is equally valid because..."

❌ **Vague recommendation:** "It depends" or "Maybe a hybrid approach"
✅ **Clear stance:** "I recommend Option 2 with selective commitment reductions to GPs X, Y, Z"

❌ **No peer integration:** Memo could have been written without attending sessions
✅ **Peer learning:** "The CFO group's presentation revealed cash flow constraints I hadn't fully appreciated"

## Connection to Learning Objectives

| Learning Objective | Rubric Criteria | Assessment Method |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Objective 1: Analyze trade-offs | Criteria 1, 4 | Recommendation memo |
| Objective 2: Evaluate stakeholders | Criterion 2 | Recommendation memo |
| Objective 3: Synthesize approach | Criterion 3 | Recommendation memo |
| Objective 4: Peer learning | Criteria 5-8 | Observation + peer feedback |

## For Facilitators: Using This Rubric

**Before Module:**
- Share rubric with learners (transparent expectations)
- Reference during sessions: "Remember, you're assessed on peer contribution"

**During Module:**
- Take observation notes on criteria 5-8
- Note exemplary behaviors to share in debrief

**After Module:**
- Score recommendation memos using criteria 1-4
- Compile peer feedback for criteria 5-8
- Provide individualized feedback on both dimensions

---

**The rubric ensures that both individual mastery AND collaborative learning are valued and assessed.**
