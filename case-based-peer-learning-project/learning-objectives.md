# Learning Objectives
## The Denominator Effect Dilemma Case Study

**Module:** Crisis Decision-Making for Institutional LPs
**Format:** Case-Based + Peer Learning
**Duration:** 3.5 hours (1 hour pre-work + 2 hour live session + 30 min post-work)
**Assessment:** Recommendation memo + peer defense

---

## Terminal Learning Objective

**By the end of this case-based learning module, LP professionals will be able to:**

> **Given a portfolio crisis scenario with incomplete information and competing stakeholder pressures** (Condition), **LP professionals** (Audience) **will analyze trade-offs, synthesize a crisis management approach, and defend their recommendation** (Behavior) **using evidence from case data, stakeholder perspectives, and professional judgment with clarity sufficient to persuade a skeptical board** (Degree).

**Bloom's Level:** Synthesis + Evaluation (highest levels of cognitive complexity)

---

## Enabling Learning Objectives (Building Blocks)

### Objective 1: Analyze Portfolio Crisis Dynamics (Analysis Level)

**ABCD Format:**
- **Audience (A):** LP professionals
- **Behavior (B):** Evaluate trade-offs between policy compliance and portfolio performance
- **Condition (C):** Given quantitative data (allocation percentages, cash flow projections, commitment schedules) and qualitative factors (GP relationships, reputation risk)
- **Degree (D):** Identifying at least 3 key trade-offs with supporting evidence from case exhibits

**Full Statement:**
> Given quantitative portfolio data and qualitative factors in the denominator effect case, LP professionals will evaluate trade-offs between policy compliance and portfolio performance, identifying at least 3 key trade-offs with supporting evidence from case exhibits.

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Learner's written analysis cites specific data from Exhibits A-C
- Identifies competing priorities (e.g., "short-term policy violation vs. long-term relationship preservation")
- Shows quantitative reasoning ("Going to 40% allocation violates policy by 15 percentage points")

**Why This Matters:**
Before learners can synthesize a solution, they must understand the problem's complexity. This objective ensures they can break down the crisis into component parts.

---

### Objective 2: Evaluate Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives (Evaluation Level)

**ABCD Format:**
- **Audience (A):** LP professionals
- **Behavior (B):** Defend a recommendation that considers multiple stakeholder viewpoints
- **Condition (C):** When presented with conflicting perspectives (board, CIO, CFO, GPs, beneficiaries)
- **Degree (D):** Addressing at least 3 stakeholder concerns in their recommendation rationale and anticipating 2 counter-arguments

**Full Statement:**
> When presented with conflicting stakeholder perspectives in the case, LP professionals will defend a recommendation that addresses at least 3 stakeholder concerns and anticipates 2 counter-arguments.

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Recommendation explicitly addresses board chair's policy concern, CIO's relationship concern, CFO's cash flow concern
- Learner demonstrates empathy: "From the board's perspective, policy compliance is paramount because..."
- Anticipates objections: "A counter-argument would be that this damages GP relationships, but..."

**Why This Matters:**
Real LP decisions involve navigating organizational politics and diverse stakeholder priorities. This objective ensures learners can "play the whole chessboard," not just their own viewpoint.

---

### Objective 3: Synthesize Crisis Management Approach (Synthesis Level)

**ABCD Format:**
- **Audience (A):** LP professionals
- **Behavior (B):** Propose a crisis management approach integrating quantitative analysis, qualitative judgment, and stakeholder management
- **Condition (C):** Given incomplete information and time pressure
- **Degree (D):** With a clear recommendation, supporting rationale, implementation steps, and risk mitigation strategy

**Full Statement:**
> Given incomplete information and time pressure in the case, LP professionals will propose a crisis management approach that integrates quantitative analysis and qualitative judgment, providing a clear recommendation, supporting rationale, implementation steps, and risk mitigation strategy.

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Clear recommendation (e.g., "We should pursue Option 2: selectively reduce commitments with newer GP relationships")
- Rationale combines numbers ("This keeps us at 33% allocation, within board tolerance") and relationships ("Preserves our most critical partnerships")
- Implementation plan (How? "Start with GPs X, Y, Z; have CIO make calls personally within 2 weeks")
- Risk mitigation ("If GPs push back, we can offer to increase future commitments once rebalanced")

**Why This Matters:**
Synthesis is the highest-order skill. Learners must integrate everything—data, perspectives, constraints—into a coherent, defensible action plan. This is what LPs actually do in crises.

---

## Peer Learning Objectives (Collaborative Dimension)

In addition to individual analysis, learners will demonstrate peer learning skills:

### Objective 4: Engage in High-Quality Peer Discussion

**ABCD Format:**
- **Audience (A):** LP professionals in peer groups
- **Behavior (B):** Contribute meaningfully to peer discussions by sharing insights, challenging assumptions respectfully, and building on others' ideas
- **Condition (C):** During structured peer learning activities
- **Degree (D):** With evidence of perspective-sharing (minimum 2 substantive contributions per activity), constructive challenge (asking probing questions), and synthesis (connecting ideas across peer contributions)

**Full Statement:**
> During structured peer learning activities, LP professionals will contribute meaningfully to discussions by sharing insights, challenging assumptions respectfully, and building on others' ideas, with evidence of at least 2 substantive contributions per activity, constructive challenge, and synthesis.

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Shares a perspective others haven't considered: "Has anyone thought about the impact on future fundraising?"
- Challenges respectfully: "I hear your point about GP relationships, but how do we square that with our fiduciary duty?"
- Builds on ideas: "Building on Sarah's comment about cash flow, what if we also consider..."
- Synthesizes: "It sounds like we're all wrestling with the tension between short-term policy and long-term relationships"

**Why This Matters:**
Case-based learning works BECAUSE of peer discussion. Learners deepen understanding by seeing the case through others' eyes. This objective ensures they don't just "show up" but actively contribute to collective learning.

## Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment

| Objective | Bloom's Level | Verb | Why This Level |
|-----------|---------------|------|----------------|
| Objective 1 | **Analysis** | Evaluate trade-offs | Breaking down complex situation into components |
| Objective 2 | **Evaluation** | Defend recommendation | Making judgments about quality, value, or appropriateness |
| Objective 3 | **Synthesis** | Propose approach | Putting elements together into coherent, novel solution |
| Objective 4 | **Synthesis** | Contribute to discussion | Combining ideas from multiple sources into new insights |

**Note:** All objectives are at the **highest levels** of Bloom's taxonomy (Analysis, Evaluation, Synthesis). This is appropriate for:
- Experienced professionals (not beginners)
- Complex, ambiguous problems (not simple procedures)
- Decision-making skills (not knowledge recall)

---

## Measurability Check

Each objective passes the "Can we assess this?" test:

| Objective | Assessment Method | Observable Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Objective 1: Analyze | Written analysis section | Learner identifies trade-offs with exhibit citations |
| Objective 2: Evaluate | Recommendation memo | Learner addresses multiple stakeholder concerns |
| Objective 3: Synthesize | Full recommendation + defense | Clear decision, rationale, implementation plan |
| Objective 4: Peer learning | Observation + peer feedback | Facilitator tracks contributions; peers rate each other |

**No unmeasurable verbs** like "understand," "appreciate," or "be familiar with." Every objective uses **observable, measurable verbs**.

---

## Scaffolding Sequence

The objectives are sequenced to build on each other:

```
Step 1: ANALYZE the problem (break it down)
        ↓
Step 2: EVALUATE multiple perspectives (see through others' eyes)
        ↓
Step 3: SYNTHESIZE a solution (put it together)
        ↓
Step 4: PEER LEARNING enhances all steps (collective intelligence)
```

**Pedagogical rationale:**
- Can't synthesize until you've analyzed
- Can't defend a recommendation without considering stakeholders
- Peer learning accelerates each step by exposing learners to diverse thinking

## Alignment with ILPA Learning Goals

These objectives align with ILPA Institute's broader LP professional development goals:

| ILPA Core Competency | This Module's Contribution |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Portfolio Construction & Management** | Analyzing allocation decisions under crisis |
| **Risk Management** | Evaluating trade-offs between different risk types (policy, relationship, liquidity) |
| **Stakeholder Communication** | Defending decisions to boards, GPs, beneficiaries |
| **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty** | Synthesizing approach with incomplete information |
| **Peer Network Development** | Building relationships through collaborative case analysis |

---

## Pre-Assessment (Baseline Check)

Before the case, learners will complete a brief pre-assessment to check readiness:

**Required prerequisite knowledge:**
- ✅ Understand portfolio allocation percentages
- ✅ Know what unfunded commitments are
- ✅ Familiar with denominator effect concept
- ✅ Basic stakeholder management awareness

**Pre-assessment questions:**
1. "What is the denominator effect?" (concept check)
2. "Why might an LP's board care about allocation policy compliance?" (stakeholder awareness)
3. "Have you personally experienced or observed a portfolio crisis situation?" (context activation)

**Purpose:** Not to gate-keep, but to activate prior knowledge (Merrill's "Activation" principle) and identify learners who may need additional support.

---

## Post-Assessment (Outcome Verification)

**Formative Assessment (During Module):**
- Peer discussion quality (observed by facilitator)
- Preliminary recommendation (posted before peer discussion)
- Revised recommendation (after peer learning)

**Summative Assessment (End of Module):**
- **Final Recommendation Memo (Individual):** 2-3 pages addressing all 3 enabling objectives
- **Board Defense (Peer Simulation):** 10-minute defense to "board" (other learners), answering tough questions

**Rubric dimensions:**
- Analysis quality (Objective 1)
- Stakeholder consideration (Objective 2)
- Synthesis and clarity (Objective 3)
- Peer contribution (Objective 4)

See `assessment-rubric.md` for detailed scoring criteria.

---

## Success Criteria

**Learners successfully achieve objectives if:**
- 80%+ of learners score "proficient" or higher on the recommendation memo
- Peer discussions remain on-task and high-level (not superficial) 75%+ of time
- Learners report that peer discussion changed or deepened their thinking (post-survey)

**Module is successful if:**
- LPs report the case felt realistic ("I could see this happening at my organization")
- LPs can articulate how they'd apply crisis decision-making framework to other portfolio issues
- LPs reference this case/framework in future ILPA programs (transfer of learning)

## Revision History

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| [Date] | Initial objectives drafted | Based on ILPA member needs assessment |
| [Date] | Added peer learning objective (#4) | Reflecting emphasis on collaborative learning |
| [Date] | Clarified measurability criteria | Feedback from ID peer review |

## Notes for SME

When drafting the case, please ensure these objectives are achievable:

- **For Objective 1 (Analyze):** Include quantitative exhibits that learners can analyze
- **For Objective 2 (Evaluate):** Include 3-4 distinct stakeholder perspectives with clear viewpoints
- **For Objective 3 (Synthesize):** Ensure no single option is obviously superior; ambiguity is key
- **For Objective 4 (Peer learning):** Case complexity should require collaboration (not solvable in 5 minutes alone)
