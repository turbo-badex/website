# Interview Presentation Guide
## How to Present This Case-Based + Peer Learning Project to ILPA
**Purpose:** Prepare you to discuss this instructional design work compellingly in your interview

---

## 30-Second Opening Statement

**When they ask: "Walk us through a sample project from your portfolio"**

> "I designed a case-based peer learning module for institutional LP education—focusing specifically on the instructional architecture, not the case content itself.
>
> Starting with ABCD learning objectives, I created a design brief that guides an LP practitioner (SME) in developing a 'messy' case with competing stakeholder pressures and no single right answer.
>
> My core contribution is the peer learning protocol—five specific touchpoints where learners interact to deepen understanding—plus scaffolding tools that keep discussions productive and high-level. I also designed the assessment rubric, facilitator guide, and implementation plan.
>
> This demonstrates how I'd collaborate with ILPA's LP practitioner SMEs to create learning experiences that are both realistic and pedagogically sound."

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Immediately establishes LP domain fluency (denominator effect)
- ✅ Clarifies ID role vs. SME role (critical for ILPA context)
- ✅ Highlights SME collaboration (key JD requirement)
- ✅ Mentions concrete deliverables (peer protocol, rubric, guide)
- ✅ Ends with value proposition to ILPA

## Key Talking Points Aligned to JD Requirements

### JD Requirement 1: "Design, update and maintain case studies"

**Your response:**
"In this project, I created a case design brief that specifies exactly what characteristics the case needs to achieve the learning objectives. For instance, the brief defines required 'messiness' specifications—what information should be deliberately incomplete, which stakeholders should conflict, and what should have no obvious right answer. This ensures the SME drafts a case that's not just interesting, but pedagogically effective."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you understand ID role in case development
- Demonstrates strategic thinking (requirements before content)
- Proves you can guide SMEs without doing their job

---

### JD Requirement 2: "Implement learning management principles"

**Your response:**
"I applied backward design methodology—started with terminal learning objectives at Bloom's analysis and evaluation levels, designed the assessment that would prove those objectives, then worked backward to determine what case characteristics would enable that learning. The peer learning protocol uses research-backed active learning principles: spaced repetition, collaborative sense-making, and metacognitive reflection."

**Why this works:**
- Name-drops instructional design frameworks (backward design, Bloom's)
- Shows evidence-based approach (research-backed)
- Demonstrates rigor (not just guessing what might work)

---

### JD Requirement 3: "Translate complex information into engaging content"

**Your response:**
"LP crisis decision-making involves complex portfolio math, policy constraints, and relationship dynamics. The case design brief specifies simplification strategies—for example, reducing portfolio allocations from 15 asset classes to 5 maintains realism while preventing cognitive overload. The facilitator guide includes concrete examples of how to make GP relationship dynamics tangible for emerging LPs who haven't lived through these situations."

**Why this works:**
- Shows understanding of LP domain complexity
- Demonstrates cognitive load management
- Proves you can simplify without dumbing down

---

### JD Requirement 4: "Collaborate with SMEs using adult learning principles"

**Your response:**
"I documented a 7-phase SME collaboration workflow that I've refined over time. The key is balancing realism—which SMEs prioritize—with learning effectiveness, which is my responsibility. I provide SMEs with clear design briefs upfront, then review their drafts through a learning lens, offering feedback like 'This is realistic, but learners will get stuck on calculations instead of strategy—can we simplify Exhibit A?' This collaborative iteration produces cases that are both credible and teachable."

**Why this works:**
- Shows mature understanding of ID-SME dynamics
- Provides concrete example of feedback approach
- Demonstrates diplomacy and partnership mindset

---

### JD Requirement 5: "Integrate new learning techniques and technologies"

**Your response:**
"This design integrates case-based learning with structured peer learning, which research shows increases retention by 40% over individual study. The peer protocol is blended—asynchronous initial analysis to prevent groupthink, synchronous small-group discussions for deep dives, and asynchronous revision for metacognitive reflection. Technology requirements include LMS with 'post before viewing' discussion boards, breakout rooms for live sessions, and collaborative tools like Miro for gallery walks."

**Why this works:**
- Cites research (retention data)
- Shows blended learning sophistication
- Demonstrates technology fluency

---

### JD Requirement 6: "Demonstrate strong visual design skills"

**Your response:**
"The discussion scaffolding tools include role cards, stakeholder analysis templates, and board member challenge cards—all designed for clarity and usability. The peer learning protocol is visualized as a journey map showing exactly when learners interact individually vs. collaboratively. The facilitator guide uses consistent formatting, clear timing indicators, and color-coded facilitation moves for at-a-glance reference during live sessions."

**Why this works:**
- Shows attention to detail
- Demonstrates user-centered design (facilitator usability)
- Proves you create professional, polished deliverables

---

### JD Requirement 7: "Establish content workflows and governance practices"

**Your response:**
"The SME collaboration workflow document provides a repeatable process for developing future cases—from learning need identification through pilot testing. It includes templates for SME outreach emails, feedback delivery, and iteration cycles. This ensures consistent quality across multiple case development projects and enables different IDs to collaborate with different SMEs using the same proven methodology."

**Why this works:**
- Shows systems thinking (not just one-off projects)
- Demonstrates scalability mindset
- Proves you create reusable processes

---

## How to Walk Through Each Artifact

**If they ask: "Can you show us your work?"**

### Start with the learning objectives (most important):
"Here's the learning objectives document. Notice I use ABCD format—Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree—which makes objectives measurable. For example: 'Given a portfolio crisis with incomplete information, LP practitioners will evaluate trade-offs between competing stakeholder priorities and defend a recommendation that addresses at least 3 stakeholder perspectives.'"

**Point out:**
- Bloom's taxonomy levels
- Performance-based outcomes (not knowledge-based)
- Alignment to assessment

---

### Then show the peer learning protocol:
"This is the heart of the design—five specific touchpoints where learners interact:
1. Individual pre-work prevents groupthink
2. Small group stakeholder deep dives build empathy
3. Gallery walk exposes learners to multiple perspectives
4. Individual revision promotes metacognition
5. Board defense simulates real accountability

Notice each peer interaction has a different PURPOSE—this isn't just 'discuss with peers,' it's architected for specific learning outcomes."

**Point out:**
- Strategic sequencing (individual → group → individual)
- Variety of interaction modes (async, sync, small group, large group)
- Clear rationale for each touchpoint

---

### Then show discussion scaffolds:
"Without scaffolding, peer discussions often become superficial or dominated by vocal participants. These tools prevent that:
- Role cards ensure everyone contributes equally
- Question stems push beyond surface-level (e.g., 'What assumptions are we making about GP behavior?')
- Peer feedback rubric helps learners self-monitor discussion quality
- Parking lot captures tangents without derailing focus"

**Point out:**
- Research-backed techniques (role assignment prevents groupthink)
- Anticipation of common pitfalls
- Equity focus (ensuring all voices heard)

---

### Then show facilitator guide:
"This guide enables any experienced facilitator to run the session consistently. It includes minute-by-minute timing, facilitation moves for each segment, common pitfalls and how to redirect, and debriefing questions that connect the case to broader LP practice. I always design facilitator guides to be self-sufficient—minimal training required."

**Point out:**
- Timing specificity (shows you've piloted this)
- Troubleshooting section (anticipates challenges)
- Debriefing questions (transfer of learning)

---

### Then show assessment rubric:
"The rubric evaluates two dimensions: quality of individual analysis (stakeholder consideration, quantitative reasoning, risk assessment) and peer learning contribution (perspective sharing, building on others' ideas, respectful challenging). This dual assessment reinforces that learning happens both individually AND collaboratively."

**Point out:**
- Alignment to learning objectives
- Transparency (learners see rubric before submission)
- Formative feedback opportunities

---

### Optionally show SME collaboration workflow:
"If you're curious about how I work with LP practitioner SMEs, this workflow document shows the 7-phase process, sample dialogue from iteration sessions, and tips for navigating common friction points like 'SME wants to include everything.' It's the playbook I'd use to develop cases with your LP network."

**Point out:**
- Realistic friction points (shows experience)
- Diplomacy in feedback (SME relationships matter)
- Repeatable process (not ad-hoc)

---

## Anticipated Questions & Strong Responses

### Q1: "How do you ensure peer discussions stay high-level and don't devolve into superficial chatter?"

**Strong response:**
"Three mechanisms: First, role assignment—each learner has a specific role like Devil's Advocate or Synthesizer, which prevents passive participation. Second, structured protocols—discussions follow a step-by-step process with time allocations and question stems. Third, public accountability—learners know their peers will see their final recommendation, which motivates quality contributions. I also train facilitators to intervene with deepening questions when they sense surface-level discussion."

**Why it works:**
- Specific mechanisms (not vague)
- Shows anticipation of problems
- Demonstrates facilitator training mindset

---

### Q2: "How would you adapt this for fully asynchronous delivery?"

**Strong response:**
"You'd lose about 60% of the value, honestly. The magic of this design is the real-time dialogue and challenge—board defense can't be replicated asynchronously. That said, if necessary, I'd use threaded discussion boards with required peer responses, video-recorded stakeholder analyses that peers must comment on, and extend the timeline from 3.5 hours to 1 week to allow asynchronous interaction. But I'd recommend hybrid—asynchronous pre-work and post-work, but synchronous core session—as the minimum viable version."

**Why it works:**
- Honest about trade-offs (not everything works async)
- Provides adaptation if needed
- Shows strategic thinking about what's negotiable vs. essential

---

### Q3: "How do you measure whether this design actually achieves the learning objectives?"

**Strong response:**
"Multiple data points: First, the assessment rubric directly maps to learning objectives—I can see if learners demonstrate stakeholder analysis and decision defense. Second, I look for evidence of peer influence—do final recommendations reference peer insights? Third, I track recommendation changes from initial stance to final—if more than 50% revise their thinking, peer learning is working. Fourth, post-session survey asks 'What did you learn from peers that you wouldn't have figured out alone?' And long-term, I'd want to hear from LP hiring managers: Are our graduates better prepared for crisis decisions?"

**Why it works:**
- Multiple measures (not just one test)
- Shows understanding of Kirkpatrick levels
- Demonstrates commitment to continuous improvement

---

### Q4: "What if an SME pushes back on your simplification feedback?"

**Strong response:**
"It happens! My approach is to validate their expertise first—'This detail is fascinating and you're absolutely right that real portfolios work this way'—then redirect to learning objectives: 'My concern is learners will get stuck on the calculations instead of practicing stakeholder analysis.' I often ask the SME to help me solve the problem: 'How can we simplify this while maintaining credibility?' Usually they come up with the solution themselves. And sometimes I defer—if they feel strongly and it doesn't break the learning, I let them keep the complexity. The relationship matters more than winning every negotiation."

**Why it works:**
- Shows diplomacy and emotional intelligence
- Demonstrates collaborative problem-solving
- Proves you value SME relationships

---

### Q5: "How long does it take to develop a case like this from scratch?"

**Strong response:**
"The ID work is about 8-10 hours: case design brief (1-2 hours), learning design (2-3 hours), facilitation materials (2-3 hours), implementation planning (1-2 hours), and SME collaboration (1-2 hours). SME drafting adds another 3-5 hours. Total elapsed time is 4-6 weeks to allow for iteration cycles. After the first case, subsequent cases are faster because templates, scaffolds, and workflows are established. I'd estimate 50% time reduction for cases 2-5 as the process matures."

**Why it works:**
- Realistic timeline (not overpromising)
- Distinguishes ID time vs. SME time
- Shows scalability thinking

---

### Q6: "Why case-based learning instead of simulations, lectures, or other formats?"

**Strong response:**
"Cases are ideal when you want learners to practice decision-making under ambiguity with no single right answer—which describes most real LP work. Simulations are great for procedural skills with clear right answers, but they're expensive to build. Lectures are good for knowledge transfer, but don't develop judgment. Cases sit in the sweet spot: realistic enough to transfer to practice, complex enough to require analysis, and ambiguous enough to force learners to defend their reasoning. Plus, cases scale well—once developed, you can run them repeatedly."

**Why it works:**
- Shows instructional design decision-making
- Compares formats strategically
- Connects to LP context specifically

---

## How to Demonstrate LP Domain Fluency

**Sprinkle in LP terminology naturally:**
- "Denominator effect"
- "Unfunded commitments"
- "Re-up risk"
- "GP relationships"
- "Policy compliance"
- "Pacing strategy"

**Reference LP pain points:**
- "LPs consistently struggle with balancing policy compliance and relationship preservation during crises"
- "The 2022 market volatility created widespread denominator effect challenges"
- "Emerging LPs often haven't built the muscle memory for high-pressure decision-making"

**Show industry awareness:**
- "I follow ILPA's research on LP best practices"
- "I've seen CalPERS board materials that show real-world examples of these tensions"
- "Your LP Fundamentals course is great foundational content—this would be a logical next step for intermediate learners"

**Why this matters:**
- Proves you're not just a generic ID
- Shows you understand the learner audience
- Demonstrates you've done your homework on ILPA

---

## What Makes This Approach Valuable for LP Education Specifically

**Key points to emphasize:**

### 1. **Addresses LP judgment gap**
"Junior LPs can learn portfolio math from textbooks, but crisis judgment only comes from practice. Cases provide safe space to make mistakes and learn from peers who see the situation differently."

### 2. **Builds professional network**
"ILPA members are geographically dispersed. Peer learning creates connections—learners who debate this case together will call each other when facing real crises later. The learning continues beyond the session."

### 3. **Develops reputation management skills**
"LPs are accountable to boards, beneficiaries, and GPs simultaneously. The board defense portion of this case simulates that pressure and helps learners articulate decisions under scrutiny—critical for career advancement."

### 4. **Scales expert knowledge**
"ILPA has limited senior LP practitioner time. By capturing their insights in well-designed cases, we can scale that expertise to hundreds of learners. The SME invests 8-10 hours once, and their wisdom teaches for years."

### 5. **Creates institutional knowledge**
"As LP veterans retire, their pattern recognition gets lost. Cases capture 'messy' decisions that don't make it into official reports. This builds ILPA's knowledge repository."

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't say:**
- ❌ "I'd write the case myself" (that's not the ID role)
- ❌ "This would take 6 months" (overly complicated)
- ❌ "LPs need to learn X" (presumptuous about audience you're just joining)
- ❌ "I've never worked with financial services before" (even if true, frame as eager to learn, not inexperienced)
- ❌ "Peer learning always works" (be honest about trade-offs)

**Do say:**
- ✅ "I'd collaborate with your LP SMEs"
- ✅ "This could be piloted in 6 weeks"
- ✅ "I'd love to learn from ILPA members what gaps they're experiencing"
- ✅ "I've done extensive research on LP education needs to prepare"
- ✅ "Peer learning works best when scaffolded carefully"

## Body Language & Presentation Tips

### When presenting artifacts:
- **Use your hands** to guide their attention to specific sections
- **Make eye contact** when explaining rationale (not just reading documents)
- **Pause** after showing each artifact to let them absorb

### When answering questions:
- **Acknowledge the question first:** "That's a great question about..."
- **Signal your structure:** "I think about this in three parts..."
- **Use specific examples:** Not "scaffolds help," but "for example, role cards ensure..."

### Energy level:
- **Match their energy** (if they're formal, be formal; if conversational, be warm)
- **Show enthusiasm** about LP education (not generic ID enthusiasm)
- **Be confident but humble** (you have expertise, but you're eager to learn from ILPA)

---

## If They Ask: "Why ILPA? Why LP education?"

**Strong response:**
"Three reasons: First, LP education is under-resourced relative to GP education—there's real opportunity to elevate the profession. Second, ILPA members are senior practitioners with deep expertise, which makes SME collaboration especially rewarding. Third, the decisions LPs make affect pensioners, endowments, and foundations—designing learning that improves those decisions feels meaningful. Plus, I've been researching ILPA's work and I'm impressed by your commitment to professionalization of the LP community."

**Why it works:**
- Shows mission alignment
- Demonstrates you've researched ILPA
- Proves this isn't just any ID job to you

---

## Closing Statement

**When they ask: "Anything else you'd like us to know?"**

"Just that I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to bring instructional design rigor to LP education. I know ILPA Institute is expanding its offerings, and I'd love to be part of building learning experiences that are both pedagogically sound and deeply grounded in practitioner expertise. The case-based peer learning project I walked through today is the kind of work I'd be energized to do at ILPA—collaborating with your LP network to create learning that genuinely prepares the next generation of institutional investors."
