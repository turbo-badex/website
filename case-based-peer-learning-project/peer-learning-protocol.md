# Peer Learning Integration Protocol
## The Denominator Effect Dilemma Case Study

**Purpose:** This document specifies exactly WHEN and HOW learners interact with peers to deepen their understanding of the case. Peer learning is not incidental—it's systematically designed into the learning journey.

---

## The Learning Journey Architecture

```
[INDIVIDUAL]          [PEER INTERACTION]           [INDIVIDUAL]
Pre-Work              Touchpoint #1                Reflection
Read case       →     Initial Stance         →     Revise thinking
Form opinion          (Async discussion)           Consider peers
    ↓                                                    ↓
                      Touchpoint #2
                      Small Group Analysis
                      (Sync breakout)
                           ↓
                      Touchpoint #3
                      Gallery Walk
                      (Hybrid presentation)
                           ↓
[INDIVIDUAL]          Touchpoint #4                [INDIVIDUAL]
Synthesis             Cross-Pollination        →   Final decision
Draft recommendation  (Async reflection)           Prepare defense
    ↓                                                    ↓
                      Touchpoint #5
                      Board Defense
                      (Sync simulation)
```

**Key Design Principle:** Alternate between individual work and peer interaction. This ensures:
- Learners form their OWN opinions first (not just adopting peers' views)
- Peer interaction exposes them to diverse perspectives
- Individual reflection integrates peer insights into their thinking

---

## Why This Sequence Works

### Pedagogical Foundation

**Merrill's First Principles:**
- **Activation:** Individual pre-work activates prior knowledge before peer discussion
- **Demonstration:** Peers demonstrate different analytical approaches
- **Application:** Learners apply insights from peers to revise their thinking
- **Integration:** Final synthesis integrates individual + collective wisdom

**Social Constructivism (Vygotsky):**
- Learning happens through social interaction with more/differently knowledgeable others
- "Zone of Proximal Development": Peers scaffold each other's learning
- Dialogue surfaces assumptions and deepens understanding

**Cognitive Apprenticeship:**
- Learners observe peers' thinking processes (not just answers)
- Apprenticeship through explanation, questioning, and debate
- Multiple "experts" (all peers) model different approaches

---

## Touchpoint #1: Initial Stance (Asynchronous)

### When It Happens
**Timing:** After case reading, before live session (48 hours prior)
**Duration:** 30 minutes individual work + 30 minutes reading peers' posts
**Platform:** LMS discussion forum or Slack channel

### What Learners Do

**Step 1: Individual Analysis (No Peeking at Others!)**
Learners post their preliminary recommendation using this template:

```
**My Recommendation:** [Which option: 1, 2, 3, or 4, or hybrid?]

**Key Rationale (3 bullets):**
- [Main reason #1]
- [Main reason #2]
- [Main reason #3]

**Biggest Concern:**
[What worries me most about this decision?]

**Question for Peers:**
[One thing I'm uncertain about or want others' input on]
```

**Constraints:**
- 200 words maximum (forces clarity)
- Must post BEFORE reading others (enforced by LMS settings)
- Required to cite at least 1 exhibit from case

**Why This Works:**
- **Commitment:** Posting publicly creates stake in their initial position
- **Clarity:** Writing forces crisp thinking
- **Vulnerability:** Asking a question normalizes uncertainty
- **Baseline:** Establishes starting point to measure learning growth

---

**Step 2: Read & Reflect (After Everyone Posts)**
Once all learners have posted:
- Read at least 4 peers' posts
- Note where you agree, disagree, or learned something new
- Identify patterns (e.g., "Most people are leaning toward Option 2")

**Prompt for reflection:**
> "After reading peers' posts, what perspective did you NOT consider in your initial analysis?"

**Why This Works:**
- **Cognitive dissonance:** Seeing different views creates productive tension
- **Perspective-taking:** Learners practice seeing case through others' eyes
- **Preparation:** Seeds ideas for live discussion

---

### Facilitator Role at Touchpoint #1

**Before Posts:**
- Send reminder 48 hours before live session
- Emphasize "post BEFORE reading others"
- Set clear deadline (e.g., "All posts due by 5 PM Thursday")

**After Posts:**
- Skim all posts to identify patterns
- Note "outlier" positions (valuable for discussion)
- Identify common misconceptions or missed factors
- Prepare facilitation moves based on what you see

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Surface-level posts (e.g., "I pick Option 2 because it seems best")
- Missing stakeholder perspectives
- Ignoring quantitative data

**Intervention if needed:**
Follow up privately: "I noticed your post didn't address the cash flow constraint in Exhibit C—can you think about how that affects your recommendation?"

---

## Touchpoint #2: Small Group Stakeholder Analysis (Synchronous)

### When It Happens
**Timing:** Live session, first 45 minutes
**Duration:** 45 minutes total (30 min discussion + 10 min prep + 5 min transition)
**Format:** Breakout rooms (Zoom) or table groups (in-person)
**Group Size:** 4 people per group

### Purpose of This Touchpoint
Deep-dive into ONE stakeholder perspective collaboratively. This forces empathy and reveals assumptions.

---

### Setup (5 Minutes)

**Facilitator Assigns Stakeholder Roles:**
Each group of 4 receives ONE stakeholder to analyze deeply:
- Group 1: Board Investment Committee Chair
- Group 2: CIO/Investment Staff
- Group 3: CFO
- Group 4: GP Partners

**Group's Task:**
"Your group will represent [Stakeholder X]. Analyze the case ENTIRELY from their perspective. Prepare to present their view—even if you personally disagree."

**Why This Works:**
- **Deep empathy:** Forces learners to truly understand a perspective, not just acknowledge it
- **Collaborative:** 4 minds together catch nuances one person might miss
- **Role-play safety:** Easier to argue a position when it's "not really you"

---

### Group Discussion Protocol (30 Minutes)

**Roles within Each Group (Assigned by Facilitator):**
- **Analyst:** Leads analysis of what this stakeholder cares about most
- **Devil's Advocate:** Challenges group's assumptions ("But would they REALLY prioritize that over X?")
- **Synthesizer:** Keeps track of key insights, prepares summary
- **Timekeeper:** Manages time, keeps group on track

**Discussion Questions (Provided on Worksheet):**

1. **Values & Priorities (10 min):**
   - What does success look like for this stakeholder?
   - What keeps them up at night about this crisis?
   - What metrics or outcomes matter most to them?

2. **Preferred Option & Reasoning (10 min):**
   - Which option would this stakeholder advocate for? Why?
   - What evidence from the case supports their position?
   - What trade-offs would they willingly accept?

3. **Response to Counter-Arguments (10 min):**
   - How would this stakeholder respond to objections from OTHER stakeholders?
   - Example: If the board says "we must follow policy," how does the CIO respond?

**Output:** Each group prepares a 3-minute "stakeholder statement" for presentation.

---

### Why This Touchpoint Works

**Pedagogical Benefits:**
- **Perspective-taking:** Learners must inhabit a viewpoint, not just acknowledge it
- **Peer scaffolding:** Group members help each other see blind spots
- **Debate skills:** Preparing to defend a position develops argumentation
- **Complexity appreciation:** Realizing every stakeholder has valid concerns

**Common Observations:**
- Learners often say, "I didn't think about it that way until we discussed it as a group"
- Devils' advocates surface assumptions: "Wait, are we assuming the board is rigid? What if they're more flexible than policy suggests?"
- Synthesizers create clarity from messy discussion

---

### Facilitator Role at Touchpoint #2

**During Breakouts:**
- Visit each room briefly (5 min per room)
- Listen for: depth of analysis, use of case evidence, group dynamics
- Prompt if stuck: "What evidence from the case supports that the Board Chair would feel this way?"

**Red flags:**
- Group finishing early (probably superficial)
- One person dominating (prompt timekeeper to intervene)
- Ignoring case data (redirect to exhibits)

**Transition to Next Activity:**
- "You have 5 minutes to finalize your stakeholder statement"
- "Choose one person to present (2 min), another to handle Q&A"

---

## Touchpoint #3: Stakeholder Gallery Walk (Hybrid)

### When It Happens
**Timing:** Live session, minutes 45-70
**Duration:** 25 minutes total
**Format:** Presentations + Q&A

### Purpose of This Touchpoint
Expose all learners to all stakeholder perspectives. Create productive conflict between viewpoints.

---

### Presentation Format (15 Minutes Total)

**Each Group (4 groups) Presents for 3 Minutes:**
"We represent [Stakeholder]. Here's our perspective on the crisis."

**Presentation Template (Provided):**
1. Who we are and what we care about (30 sec)
2. Our preferred option and why (1 min)
3. Our response to the strongest counter-argument (1 min)
4. Our "red line" (what we absolutely can't accept) (30 sec)

**Why Short Presentations:**
- Forces clarity (no rambling)
- Maintains energy
- Leaves time for Q&A (where real learning happens)

---

### Challenger Q&A (10 Minutes Total)

**After Each Presentation:**
Other learners (representing OTHER stakeholders) challenge the presenting group.

**Facilitator:** "The Board just presented. CIO group—what's your response?"

**Example Exchange:**
> **Board (presenting):** "We must get back to 25% allocation within 12 months. Policy is policy."
>
> **CIO (challenging):** "If we fire-sell secondaries to comply, we'll destroy value. Is a policy violation really worse than losing $200M?"
>
> **Board (responding):** "Our fiduciary duty is to follow our own policy. If we ignore it, what credibility do we have with stakeholders?"

**Facilitator Role:**
- Direct questions to specific groups
- Prompt follow-ups: "CIO, I'm not convinced by that answer. Push back."
- Escalate tension (productively): "These seem like incompatible positions. Can both be right?"

**Why This Works:**
- **Cognitive dissonance:** Learners see that smart people disagree (no obvious answer)
- **Argumentation skills:** Defending position under questioning builds confidence
- **Complexity appreciation:** Realize there's no perfect solution
- **Group cohesion:** Adversarial but respectful—builds trust

---

### Debrief (5 Minutes)

**Facilitator Asks:**
- "What tensions emerged that can't be easily resolved?"
- "Which stakeholder made the most compelling argument?"
- "Has your initial recommendation changed based on these presentations?"

**Capture on Whiteboard:**
- Key tensions (e.g., "Policy Compliance vs. Relationship Preservation")
- Unresolved questions
- Trade-offs everyone faces

**Transition:**
"You've now heard 4 different perspectives. Take a break (10 min), then we'll ask you to revise your recommendation."

---

## Touchpoint #4: Cross-Pollination (Asynchronous)

### When It Happens
**Timing:** After live session, within 24 hours
**Duration:** 45 minutes individual work
**Platform:** LMS reflection journal (private, only facilitator sees)

### Purpose of This Touchpoint
Integrate peer learning into revised thinking. Metacognition about how perspective shifted.

---

### The Reflection Assignment

**Prompt:**
> After today's peer discussions, revise your recommendation. Your revised recommendation doesn't have to be different from your initial stance—but you must explain what you learned from peers and how it affected your thinking.

**Template:**

```
**My Revised Recommendation:**
[Option 1, 2, 3, 4, or hybrid? Or same as before?]

**How My Thinking Evolved:**
[What did I learn from peers that changed or deepened my analysis?]

**Specific Peer Insights I'm Integrating:**
- [Peer/Group X said _________, which made me realize _________]
- [The stakeholder presentations revealed _________]

**Remaining Uncertainties:**
[What am I still unsure about?]

**Preview of My Defense:**
[In 2-3 sentences, how will I defend this recommendation to the "board" tomorrow?]
```

**Constraints:**
- 400 words maximum
- Must reference at least 2 specific peer insights
- Due within 24 hours (before final defense session)

---

### Why This Works

**Metacognitive Benefits:**
- **Reflection:** Learners articulate HOW their thinking changed
- **Integration:** Forces synthesis of own ideas + peer insights
- **Accountability:** Can't just "go with the crowd"—must explain reasoning
- **Preparation:** Primes learners for final defense

**Common Patterns:**
- Some learners change their recommendation completely
- Others strengthen their original position with new arguments
- All learners report richer understanding of trade-offs

---

### Facilitator Role at Touchpoint #4

**Review All Reflections Before Next Session:**
- Look for: integration of peer insights, depth of revision, preparation for defense
- Identify exemplars ("Maya's reflection beautifully synthesized")
- Note learners who are still struggling

**Follow-Up if Needed:**
- Private message: "Your reflection mentioned uncertainty about X—let's discuss before tomorrow's session"
- Group email: "I'm seeing great evolution in thinking—can't wait for tomorrow's defenses!"

---

## Touchpoint #5: Board Defense (Synchronous)

### When It Happens
**Timing:** Live session #2, 90 minutes total (or end of longer session)
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Fishbowl + hot seats

### Purpose of This Touchpoint
Culminating peer learning experience: defend recommendation under questioning, learn from observing peers' defenses.

---

### Setup (5 Minutes)

**Facilitator Frames the Exercise:**
"You're presenting your recommendation to the Investment Committee Board. Your peers will role-play board members—they'll ask tough questions to stress-test your thinking."

**Role Assignments:**
- **Defender:** 1 learner presents their recommendation (5 min presentation + 5 min Q&A = 10 min total)
- **Board Members:** 4-5 other learners play skeptical board members (ask probing questions)
- **Observers:** Remaining learners watch, take notes on what makes a defense compelling

**Rotation:** Every 10 minutes, new defender; board members rotate roles.

---

### Defense Structure (10 Minutes per Learner)

**Defender's Presentation (5 Minutes):**
1. **Recommendation:** Clear statement (30 sec)
2. **Rationale:** 3 key reasons with evidence (2 min)
3. **Stakeholder Analysis:** How this addresses multiple perspectives (1 min)
4. **Implementation:** Practical steps (1 min)
5. **Risk Mitigation:** What could go wrong and how we'd respond (30 sec)

**Board Q&A (5 Minutes):**
**Board members ask challenging questions:**
- "What if GPs push back harder than you expect?"
- "How do you respond to the argument that this sets a bad precedent?"
- "What assumptions are you making that might be wrong?"

**Defender must:**
- Answer directly (no waffling)
- Cite evidence from case when possible
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly

---

### Observer Role (Active Watching)

**Observers Use Rubric to Evaluate:**
- Clarity of recommendation
- Quality of evidence
- Response to challenges
- Integration of stakeholder perspectives

**Observers Take Notes On:**
- "What made this defense compelling (or weak)?"
- "What questions revealed gaps in thinking?"
- "How did the defender handle disagreement?"

**Why Observers Matter:**
Observing peers is itself a learning activity. Learners notice:
- "I should have addressed cash flow constraints more directly"
- "That's a great way to frame the policy compliance issue"
- "I didn't think about the PR angle she mentioned"

---

### Facilitator Role at Touchpoint #5

**As Board Members Ask Questions:**
- Don't let board members be easy on defender (prompt harder questions if needed)
- Balance adversarial with respectful (no personal attacks)
- Manage time strictly (10 min per person, or not everyone gets a turn)

**After Each Defense:**
- Quick debrief (2 min): "What made that defense strong? What would you do differently?"
- Capture patterns: "I'm noticing many of you are wrestling with the trade-off between policy and relationships"

**Rotate Roles Frequently:**
- Defenders: Different learner each round
- Board Members: Rotate so everyone plays different stakeholder roles
- Observers: Rotate into board/defender roles

---

### Debrief Touchpoint #5 (15 Minutes at End)

**Facilitator Leads Group Discussion:**

**Questions:**
1. "What did you learn from defending your recommendation that you didn't realize from just writing it?"
2. "What questions from peers made you think hardest?"
3. "Whose defense made you reconsider your own position?"
4. "What skills did this exercise develop beyond case analysis?"

**Common Insights Learners Share:**
- "Having to defend out loud revealed holes in my logic"
- "Seeing different defenses showed me there really is no perfect answer"
- "I learned as much from watching others defend as from my own defense"
- "The Q&A forced me to think on my feet—that's the real skill"

**Capture Key Takeaways:**
- What makes a recommendation defensible (even if people disagree)?
- How do you handle uncertainty honestly without appearing weak?
- What's the difference between confidence and certainty?

## Summary: Why These 5 Touchpoints Work

| Touchpoint | When | Mode | Purpose | Key Benefit |
|------------|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **#1: Initial Stance** | Before live | Async | Commit to a position | Establishes baseline, creates ownership |
| **#2: Small Group Analysis** | Live session 1 | Sync | Deep-dive on stakeholder | Empathy, perspective-taking, collaborative analysis |
| **#3: Gallery Walk** | Live session 1 | Sync | Expose to all perspectives | Cognitive dissonance, argumentation, complexity |
| **#4: Cross-Pollination** | Between sessions | Async | Integrate peer insights | Metacognition, synthesis, preparation |
| **#5: Board Defense** | Live session 2 | Sync | Defend under questioning | Confidence, thinking on feet, learning from observing |

## What Makes This Protocol Effective

### 1. **Alternating Individual + Peer**
Not just "group work." Learners form opinions individually, then test them with peers, then refine individually.

### 2. **Scaffolded Complexity**
- Touchpoint #1: Simple (post your recommendation)
- Touchpoint #2: Moderate (analyze one stakeholder deeply)
- Touchpoint #3: Complex (navigate conflicting stakeholders)
- Touchpoint #4: Synthesis (integrate everything)
- Touchpoint #5: Performance (defend under pressure)

### 3. **Multiple Interaction Modes**
- Asynchronous (time to think deeply)
- Small group (intimate, safe)
- Large group (dynamic, energizing)
- Fishbowl (performance + observation)

### 4. **Forced Perspective-Taking**
Can't just state your view—must understand and represent others' views.

### 5. **Metacognitive Reflection**
Not just "what do you think?" but "how did your thinking change and why?"

---

## Common Facilitator Questions

**Q: What if learners don't post their initial stance (#1)?**
**A:** Make it required (10% of final grade) and set clear deadline. If still missing, follow up: "I noticed you haven't posted yet—do you need more time or have questions?"

**Q: What if small groups (#2) finish early?**
**A:** They're probably being superficial. Prompt: "You have 20 minutes left—dig deeper into the CFO's cash flow concerns. What specific numbers from Exhibit C matter most?"

**Q: What if no one challenges the presenter (#3)?**
**A:** Facilitate directly: "CIO group, the Board just said policy is non-negotiable. Do you accept that?" Create productive conflict.

**Q: What if a learner's defense (#5) is weak?**
**A:** Let peers ask tough questions (they'll expose gaps). Debrief constructively: "What would have made that defense stronger?"

**Q: What if the group converges on one "right" answer?**
**A:** Red flag! Introduce doubt: "I'm hearing everyone lean toward Option 2. Devil's advocate: what's the strongest argument AGAINST Option 2?" Messiness is the goal.

## Adaptation for Different Contexts

### Fully Online (No In-Person Session)
- Touchpoints #1, #4: Same (already async)
- Touchpoints #2, #3, #5: Use Zoom breakouts + main room
- Add: Optional office hours for learners who want 1-on-1 discussion

### In-Person Only (No LMS)
- Touchpoint #1: Use index cards (write recommendation, post on wall, do gallery walk)
- Touchpoint #4: Paper reflection journal, submit next session
- Touchpoints #2, #3, #5: Same as designed

### Shorter Time (90 Min Total)
- Combine Touchpoints #2 + #3 into one activity (30 min)
- Skip Touchpoint #4 (async reflection)
- Condensed Touchpoint #5: Only 4 learners defend (not everyone)

### Larger Cohort (30+ Learners)
- Multiple rooms for Touchpoint #2 (same stakeholder analyzed by 2 groups)
- Touchpoint #3: Each stakeholder presented once (not all groups)
- Touchpoint #5: Fishbowl with 6 defenders, rest observe

---

## Success Metrics

**You'll know the protocol is working if:**
- ✅ Learners reference peers' ideas in their final recommendations ("As Sarah pointed out...")
- ✅ Discussions go deep (not surface-level)
- ✅ Learners challenge each other respectfully
- ✅ Post-session survey: "Peer discussion deepened my understanding" (80%+ agree)
- ✅ Final recommendations are more nuanced than initial posts

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Same 2-3 people dominate all discussions
- ❌ Learners agree too quickly (no productive conflict)
- ❌ Final recommendations are identical to initial posts (no learning)
- ❌ Learners don't reference case data (opinions without evidence)

---

## Connection to Other Artifacts

- **Learning Objectives:** This protocol achieves Objectives 1-4 (analysis, evaluation, synthesis, peer contribution)
- **Discussion Scaffolds:** See `discussion-scaffolds.md` for specific question prompts, role cards, and rubrics used at each touchpoint
- **Facilitator Guide:** See `facilitator-guide.md` for detailed facilitation moves, timing, and troubleshooting
- **Assessment Rubric:** See `assessment-rubric.md` for how peer contribution is evaluated

---

## Final Note for Facilitators

This protocol requires discipline:
- **Don't skip touchpoints** ("We're short on time, let's skip the stakeholder presentations")
- **Don't let groups go too long** (every minute over means less time for others)
- **Don't rescue learners** (let productive struggle happen)
- **Do intervene if toxic** (disrespect, dominance, exclusion)

**The protocol works BECAUSE it's structured.** Trust the process.
