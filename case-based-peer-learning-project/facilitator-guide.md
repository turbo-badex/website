# Facilitator Guide
## The Denominator Effect Dilemma Case Study

**Role:** Session facilitator/instructor
**Module Duration:** 3.5 hours total (1 hour pre-work + 2 hour live session + 30 min post-work)
**Cohort Size:** 16-20 learners (optimal)

---

## Pre-Session Preparation (1 Week Before)

### Checklist
- [ ] Send case study PDF to learners (1 week before)
- [ ] Set up LMS discussion forum for Touchpoint #1

### What to Look For in Pre-Work Posts
- **Depth:** Are they citing case evidence or just opinions?
- **Diversity:** Do we have different recommendations to explore?
- **Misconceptions:** Any common misunderstandings to address?
- **Outliers:** Unique perspectives to elevate during discussion?

## Detailed Facilitation Moves

### Opening (10 Min)

**Hook:**
"You've all read the case. Quick poll: How many of you changed your mind after reading peers' initial posts? [Show of hands]. That's peer learning in action. Today, we go deeper."

**Set Norms:**
1. Evidence-based discussion (cite the case)
2. Respectful disagreement is expected
3. There's no single right answer
4. Learn from each other, not just me

**Learning Objectives:**
Display on screen. "By end of today, you'll be able to analyze crisis trade-offs, evaluate stakeholder perspectives, and synthesize a defensible recommendation."

---

### Debrief Initial Stance (5 Min)

**Purpose:** Show diversity of thinking, prime for discussion

**Moves:**
- "I reviewed your posts. We have recommendations spanning all 4 options plus some creative hybrids. That's exactly what we want—messy, real-world complexity."
- Highlight interesting perspectives: "[Name] raised a great point about reputational risk that I didn't see in other posts."
- Don't reveal which option is "most popular" yet (premature consensus)

---

### Touchpoint #2: Stakeholder Analysis (45 Min)

**Setup (5 Min):**
- Assign breakout rooms
- Distribute role cards
- Project stakeholder assignments on screen
- "You have 45 minutes. Your group represents [Stakeholder]. Analyze the case ENTIRELY from their perspective."

**During Breakouts (30 Min):**
Visit each room (7-8 min per room):
- **Listen first** (2 min): What's the quality of discussion?
- **Prompt if needed** (3 min):
  - Superficial → "What specific data from Exhibit C supports that?"
  - Stuck → "How would the CFO respond to the Board Chair's policy concern?"
  - Dominance → "Timekeeper, let's hear from [quiet member]"
- **Check progress** (2 min): "You have 15 minutes left. Make sure you're preparing your statement."

**Red Flags & Interventions:**
- **Group finishes early** → "You're done? Let's go deeper. What's the Board Chair's biggest fear? What keeps them up at night?"
- **Off-topic** → "Interesting tangent. Let's park that and refocus on THIS stakeholder's view of THIS crisis."
- **No evidence** → "I'm hearing opinions. Can someone find an exhibit that supports this?"

**Prep for Presentations (10 Min):**
"5 minutes to finalize. Choose a presenter. Anticipate questions from other groups."

---

### Touchpoint #3: Gallery Walk (25 Min)

**Presentation Format:**
"Each group has 3 minutes to present their stakeholder's view. Then 2 minutes of Q&A from other groups."

**Facilitation Moves:**

**1. Manage Time:**
Use visible timer. At 2:30, "30 seconds." At 3:00, "Thank you, let's move to Q&A."

**2. Create Productive Tension:**
After Board presents, direct question to CIO group: "The Board just said policy is non-negotiable. CIO group—respond."

**3. Elevate Conflict:**
"These seem like incompatible positions. Can both be right? Or does someone have to lose?"

**4. Require Evidence:**
If answer is vague: "What exhibit supports that GP reaction?"

**5. Prevent Easy Outs:**
If someone says "It depends," push: "On what specifically? How would you decide?"

**Sample Exchanges to Facilitate:**
- Board vs. CIO: Policy compliance vs. relationship preservation
- CIO vs. CFO: Long-term relationships vs. short-term cash needs
- CFO vs. Board: Operational reality vs. policy ideals

**After All Presentations:**
"Let's capture the tensions on the whiteboard." List them:
- Policy vs. Performance
- Short-term pain vs. Long-term relationships
- Quantitative data vs. Qualitative judgment
- Individual GP relationships vs. Portfolio-wide strategy

---

### Debrief Tensions (10 Min)

**Questions:**
1. "Which tension do you find hardest to resolve?"
2. "Has anyone's recommendation shifted after hearing all stakeholders?"
3. "What makes this decision so difficult? Why isn't there an obvious answer?"

**Capture Insights:**
- "Great observation: every stakeholder is 'right' from their perspective"
- "That's the synthesis challenge: how do you honor competing truths?"

---

### Break (10 Min)

Give them space to process. Don't rush.

---

### Touchpoint #4 Preview (15 Min)

**Frame the Assignment:**
"You've heard 4 stakeholder perspectives and your peers' initial thinking. Now, revise your recommendation—or strengthen your original one. Either is fine, but explain what you learned from peers."

**Show the Template:**
Project the reflection template on screen. Walk through each section.

**Emphasize:**
- "This isn't about changing your mind to match others. It's about integrating peer insights."
- "Due tomorrow by 5 PM. I'll review before our next session."
- "This reflection directly connects to your final assessment."

---

### Close Session 1 (5 Min)

**Preview Next Session:**
"Next time: Board Defense. You'll present your recommendation to a skeptical board (your peers). Prepare to defend under questioning."

**Logistics:**
- Check calendar for Session 2
- Remind about reflection deadline
- Answer questions

---

## Between Sessions: Review Reflections

**What to Look For:**
- ✅ Integration of peer insights (not just "I agree with Sarah")
- ✅ Evolution of thinking ("I initially thought X, but now I realize Y because...")
- ✅ Remaining uncertainties (shows intellectual honesty)
- ❌ No change at all (did they engage with peers?)
- ❌ Complete flip without rationale (did they think critically?)

**Follow-Up if Needed:**
Message learners who need support: "I noticed your reflection didn't mention how peer discussion affected your thinking. Can you elaborate?"

---

## Session 2: Board Defense (90 Min)

### Opening (5 Min)

**Welcome Back:**
"I read your reflections—impressive evolution of thinking. Today: defend your recommendations. Your peers will play a tough board."

**Set Expectations:**
- Defenders: Be clear, use evidence, acknowledge trade-offs honestly
- Board Members: Ask hard questions, but stay respectful
- Observers: Watch for what makes defenses compelling

---

### Touchpoint #5: Rotational Defenses (70 Min)

**Structure:** 10 min per defender × 7 defenders = 70 min

**For Each Defense:**

**1. Defender Presents (5 Min):**
Use timer. If over time, "30 seconds to wrap up."

**2. Board Q&A (5 Min):**
Assign 4 "board members" (rotate learners).

**Sample Board Questions to Prompt:**
- "How do you respond to the concern that this damages our reputation?"
- "What assumptions could make your recommendation wrong?"
- "Walk me through the math—how did you calculate that?"
- "If GPs push back harder than you expect, then what?"

**3. Facilitator Intervention:**
If board is too easy: "Board, that's not convincing. Push harder."
If board is unfair: "Let's keep questions focused on the case, not personal."

**4. Quick Debrief (1 Min):**
"What made that defense strong?" or "What would improve it?"

**5. Rotate:**
New defender, new board members, previous defender becomes observer.

---

### Final Debrief (15 Min)

**Extract Learning:**
1. "What did you learn from defending that you didn't realize from just writing?"
2. "Whose defense made you reconsider your position?"
3. "What makes a recommendation 'defensible' even if people disagree?"

**Key Takeaways:**
- There's no perfect answer, but some are more defensible than others
- Acknowledging trade-offs honestly > pretending there's no downside
- Confidence without certainty: "I believe this is right, but I could be wrong"

**Connection to Real LP Work:**
"You'll face decisions like this throughout your careers. No amount of analysis eliminates ambiguity. The skill is making the best call with incomplete information and defending it clearly."

## Common Facilitation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Dominators

**Signs:** Same 2-3 people talk in every activity

**Interventions:**
- **Early:** "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet. [Name]?"
- **Mid-session:** "I'm noticing some voices we haven't heard. Timekeeper, make sure everyone speaks."
- **Persistent:** Private conversation at break: "You're contributing great ideas. Can you help me bring out quieter voices?"

---

### Challenge 2: Premature Consensus

**Signs:** Group quickly agrees on one answer without exploring alternatives

**Interventions:**
- "Interesting—everyone's leaning toward Option 2. Devil's advocate: what's the strongest argument AGAINST Option 2?"
- Assign someone to argue the opposite: "[Name], take the Board Chair's perspective. Why is Option 2 unacceptable?"
- Introduce new information: "What if the GP pushback is worse than we expect? Does that change the analysis?"

---

### Challenge 3: Superficial Discussion

**Signs:** Opinions without evidence, vague statements, no depth

**Interventions:**
- "I'm hearing opinions. What does the case actually say? Someone find Exhibit B."
- "That's an assertion. What evidence supports it?"
- Raise the bar: "We can do deeper than that. Why does the CFO care about cash flow? What's at stake?"

---

### Challenge 4: Silent Participants

**Signs:** Some learners never speak

**Approaches:**
- **Think-Pair-Share:** Give individual think time before discussion (lowers barrier)
- **Round Robin:** "Let's go around. Everyone share one insight."
- **Role Assignment:** Silent learner becomes Timekeeper (low-risk contribution) or Synthesizer (must speak to summarize)
- **Private Check-In:** At break, "I noticed you're quiet. How can I support your participation?"

---

### Challenge 5: Toxic Behavior

**Signs:** Personal attacks, dismissiveness, interruptions

**Immediate Intervention:**
- "Let's pause. Remember our norm: respectful disagreement. Critique the idea, not the person."
- **Private conversation:** "Your contributions are valuable, but interrupting others shuts down discussion. Can you work on that?"
- **Persistent:** Remove from session if necessary (rare, but protect group safety)

---

## Facilitator Self-Reflection

After each session, assess:
- ✅ Did discussions stay evidence-based?
- ✅ Did most learners contribute?
- ✅ Did we explore multiple perspectives?
- ✅ Was there productive disagreement?
- ✅ Did learners report learning from peers?

**If no to any:** What facilitation moves would help next time?

---

## Adaptation for Different Contexts

### Fully Virtual
- Use breakout rooms for Touchpoint #2
- Use polls to gauge opinion shifts
- Use chat for "parking lot"
- Record sessions for absent learners

### In-Person
- Use physical role cards
- Flip chart for stakeholder presentations
- Table groups for breakouts
- Sticky notes for parking lot

### Shorter Time (90 Min Total)
- Combine Touchpoints #2 + #3 (30 min)
- Skip Touchpoint #4 (async reflection)
- Streamline Touchpoint #5 (4 defenders only)

### Larger Cohort (30+)
- Multiple groups analyze same stakeholder
- Select best presentation from each
- Fishbowl format for Touchpoint #5

---

## Connection to Other Artifacts

- **Peer Learning Protocol:** This guide operationalizes each touchpoint
- **Discussion Scaffolds:** Specific tools used throughout (role cards, prompts, rubrics)
- **Assessment Rubric:** Used to evaluate individual + peer contributions
- **Learning Objectives:** Everything here serves Objectives 1-4

---

## Final Advice for New Facilitators

**Trust the Process:** The protocol works. Don't skip steps because "we're running behind."

**Let Them Struggle:** Productive struggle = learning. Don't rescue too quickly.

**Model Behavior:** If you want respectful disagreement, model it. Challenge learners' ideas respectfully.

**Stay Neutral:** Don't reveal which option YOU'D choose. Your job: facilitate, not tell them the answer.

**Celebrate Growth:** Notice and name when learners demonstrate great peer learning: "That's an excellent example of building on a peer's idea."

**Good facilitation makes great case-based learning possible. You've got this!**
