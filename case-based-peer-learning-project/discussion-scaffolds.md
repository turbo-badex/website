# Discussion Scaffolding Tools
## Keeping Peer Discussions Productive and High-Level

**Purpose:** These tools ensure peer discussions stay focused, deep, and equitable. Without scaffolding, discussions often become superficial, dominated by vocal participants, or drift off-topic.

---

## Tool 1: Role Cards for Small Groups

### Purpose
Assign specific responsibilities in peer discussions to prevent groupthink and ensure multiple perspectives.

### The Four Roles

#### **Analyst**
**Responsibility:** Lead the analysis, focus on evidence from case
**Prompts to use:**
- "What does the data in Exhibit [X] tell us?"
- "Let's look at the specific numbers..."
- "What evidence supports this conclusion?"

**Key behaviors:**
- Cite specific case facts
- Point group back to exhibits when discussion gets vague
- Keep analysis grounded in data

---

####**Devil's Advocate**
**Responsibility:** Challenge assumptions, surface blind spots
**Prompts to use:**
- "But what if...?"
- "Are we assuming...?"
- "How would [stakeholder X] respond to this?"
- "What's the strongest argument AGAINST our position?"

**Key behaviors:**
- Question consensus (respectfully)
- Surface unstated assumptions
- Play opposing viewpoint even if you personally agree

---

#### **Synthesizer**
**Responsibility:** Track key insights, prepare summary, connect ideas
**Prompts to use:**
- "So it sounds like we're saying..."
- "How does this connect to what we discussed earlier about...?"
- "Our main points are..."

**Key behaviors:**
- Take notes on whiteboard/doc
- Summarize periodically
- Prepare group's final statement

---

#### **Timekeeper**
**Responsibility:** Manage time, ensure balanced participation
**Prompts to use:**
- "We have 15 minutes left, let's move to question 2"
- "[Name], you haven't shared your thoughts yet—what do you think?"
- "Let's make sure everyone has spoken before we move on"

**Key behaviors:**
- Watch the clock
- Ensure quiet members speak
- Redirect dominating members tactfully

---

### How to Use Role Cards

**Facilitator distributes cards at start of breakout:**
"You'll each have a role in today's discussion. Read your role card—it tells you what to focus on."

**Rotation:**
- Switch roles for each activity (Analyst in Activity 1 becomes Devil's Advocate in Activity 2)
- Ensures everyone practices different skills

**Reflection:**
At end of session, ask: "How did having assigned roles change the discussion quality?"

---

## Tool 2: Discussion Protocol (Step-by-Step Process)

### Purpose
Structured process prevents aimless discussion. Each peer interaction follows a protocol.

### Protocol for Touchpoint #2 (Stakeholder Analysis)

**Phase 1: Silent Review (3 min)**
- Everyone re-reads case section about their assigned stakeholder
- Individual notes: What does this stakeholder care about?

**Phase 2: Round Robin Sharing (8 min, 2 min each)**
- Timekeeper: "Let's go around. Each person share one key insight. [Name], start us off."
- NO interruptions during sharing
- Analyst takes notes

**Phase 3: Open Discussion (15 min)**
- Analyst: "Based on what we shared, what's this stakeholder's biggest concern?"
- Devil's Advocate: "Are we assuming anything we shouldn't?"
- Synthesizer: Captures emerging consensus

**Phase 4: Prepare Presentation (10 min)**
- Synthesizer drafts stakeholder statement
- Group refines together
- Choose presenter

**Phase 5: Practice (4 min)**
- Quick run-through
- Anticipate questions from other groups

---

### Why Protocol Matters

**Without protocol:**
- Dominant personalities talk most
- Group jumps to conclusions
- Quiet members don't contribute
- Run out of time

**With protocol:**
- Everyone contributes equally (round robin)
- Ideas build on each other (structured phases)
- Time is managed (phases have durations)
- Output is clear (synthesizer tracks)

---

## Tool 3: Question Stems (High-Level Prompts)

### Purpose
Push discussions beyond surface level. These questions force deeper thinking.

### Analysis-Level Questions
(Bloom's: Breaking down complex information)

- "What's the trade-off between [X] and [Y]?"
- "How does [Stakeholder A] define success differently than [Stakeholder B]?"
- "What assumptions are we making about [GP behavior / market recovery / board flexibility]?"
- "What does the data in Exhibit [X] actually tell us? What doesn't it tell us?"

---

### Evaluation-Level Questions
(Bloom's: Making judgments, defending positions)

- "Which stakeholder has the most compelling argument? Why?"
- "If you had to defend [Option X] to a skeptical board, what's your strongest evidence?"
- "What information, if we had it, would completely change our recommendation?"
- "How would you defend this decision 3 years from now if it goes wrong?"

---

### Synthesis-Level Questions
(Bloom's: Combining elements into new solution)

- "Can we find a hybrid approach that addresses multiple stakeholder concerns?"
- "What would a compromise look like between [Position A] and [Position B]?"
- "How do we balance [short-term risk] with [long-term opportunity]?"
- "What creative solution haven't we considered yet?"

---

### Metacognitive Questions
(Thinking about thinking)

- "What did [Peer Name]'s comment make you reconsider?"
- "How has your thinking evolved from your initial recommendation?"
- "What are we NOT discussing that we should be?"
- "Why is this decision so hard? What makes it ambiguous?"

---

### When to Use Question Stems

**Facilitator uses these:**
- When discussion goes superficial: "Let's go deeper. What's the trade-off here?"
- When group reaches quick consensus: "Devil's advocate: what's the strongest argument AGAINST this?"
- During Q&A: "CIO group, how would you respond to the Board's policy concern?"

**Learners use these:**
- On role cards (prompts for each role)
- In reflection assignments ("Use one of these stems to analyze...")
- During peer defense ("Board members should ask evaluation-level questions")

---

## Tool 4: Peer Feedback Rubric

### Purpose
Help learners self-monitor discussion quality. Transparent criteria for what "good peer contribution" looks like.

### The Rubric

| Dimension | Developing (1) | Proficient (2) | Exemplary (3) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Evidence Use** | Opinions without case data | Some references to case | Consistently cites exhibits |
| **Perspective-Taking** | Only shares own view | Acknowledges other views | Deeply explores other perspectives |
| **Questioning** | Doesn't ask questions | Asks clarifying questions | Asks probing, high-level questions |
| **Building on Ideas** | Ignores peers' comments | Responds to peers | Synthesizes across peers' ideas |
| **Respect** | Dismissive or silent | Respectful disagreement | Constructive challenge |

---

### How to Use the Rubric

**Self-Assessment (Reflection Assignment):**
"Rate yourself on each dimension. Provide one example of when you demonstrated each behavior."

**Peer Feedback:**
"Rate 2 peers who contributed to your learning today. One strength they demonstrated, one area for growth."

**Facilitator Observation:**
Facilitator tracks contributions during live session, provides feedback to individuals afterward.

---

## Tool 5: "Parking Lot" for Tangents

### Purpose
Capture interesting but off-topic ideas without derailing the discussion.

### How It Works

**Physical (In-Person):**
- Flip chart or whiteboard labeled "Parking Lot"
- When discussion drifts, facilitator says: "That's interesting, but let's park that for now" (writes it down)
- Revisit at end if time permits

**Virtual (Zoom):**
- Shared Google Doc visible to all
- Section labeled "Parking Lot Questions"
- Anyone can add to it during discussion

---

### Example Use

**Scenario:**
During stakeholder analysis (#2), group starts debating whether GPs should offer commitment flexibility generally.

**Facilitator intervenes:**
"That's a great broader question about industry norms. For now, let's focus on THIS specific case. I'll add 'Should GPs offer more commitment flexibility?' to the parking lot, and we can discuss after if there's time."

**Why This Works:**
- Honors the contribution (doesn't shut down)
- Maintains focus (doesn't derail)
- Creates space for tangents later (if time allows)

---

## Tool 6: Discussion Quality Checklist

### Purpose
Quick diagnostic for facilitators and learners to assess if discussion is productive.

### The Checklist

**Is the discussion HIGH-QUALITY if:**
- [ ] Multiple perspectives are shared (not just one dominant voice)
- [ ] Participants cite specific case evidence (not just opinions)
- [ ] Disagreement is present and respectful (not premature consensus)
- [ ] Questions are probing, not superficial ("Why?" vs. "What do you think?")
- [ ] Participants build on each other's ideas (not parallel monologues)
- [ ] Time is managed well (not rushing or running out)
- [ ] Quiet members are invited to speak
- [ ] Discussion connects to learning objectives (not aimless)

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Same person talks for 5+ minutes straight
- ❌ No one cites case data for 10+ minutes
- ❌ Group agrees on answer within first 5 minutes
- ❌ Personal attacks or dismissiveness
- ❌ Off-topic conversation for 5+ minutes

---

### How to Use the Checklist

**During Discussion (Facilitator):**
Scan the room/breakouts. If you notice red flags, intervene:
- Dominance → "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- No evidence → "What does Exhibit B tell us about this?"
- Premature consensus → "Devil's advocate: what's wrong with this answer?"

**Post-Discussion (Learner Reflection):**
"Looking at the quality checklist, which elements did our group do well? Which could we improve?"

---

## Tool 7: Sentence Starters for Constructive Challenge

### Purpose
Model language for disagreeing respectfully. Many learners avoid disagreement because they don't know HOW to disagree without offending.

### The Sentence Starters

**Acknowledging Before Challenging:**
- "I hear your point about [X], and I'm wondering..."
- "That's a valid perspective. I'm thinking about it differently because..."
- "I appreciate that reasoning. Let me play devil's advocate..."

**Probing Assumptions:**
- "What if we're assuming [X], but actually [Y]?"
- "I'm wondering if we're overlooking [consideration]..."
- "Help me understand how you're thinking about [specific factor]..."

**Building While Redirecting:**
- "Building on what you said, what if we also consider...?"
- "That makes sense for [Stakeholder A]. How does [Stakeholder B] view it?"
- "I agree with [part of your argument], but I'm concerned about [specific risk]..."

**Synthesizing Disagreement:**
- "It sounds like we're both right, but prioritizing different values..."
- "These seem like incompatible positions. Is there a way to satisfy both?"
- "We're disagreeing on [specific point]. What evidence would resolve this?"

---

### How to Teach These

**Model It:**
Facilitator demonstrates during session: "I hear the CIO group's point about relationships. Let me play devil's advocate: what if policy compliance matters more?"

**Post on Walls/Screens:**
Display sentence starters visibly during breakouts so learners can reference them.

**Reinforce:**
When a learner disagrees well, name it: "Great example of constructive challenge. You acknowledged their point, then offered a different angle."

---

## Tool 8: Equity Sticks (Ensuring Participation)

### Purpose
Ensure all voices are heard, especially quiet members.

### How It Works

**Physical (In-Person):**
- Everyone gets 3 poker chips/sticks
- Each time you speak, put one chip in the center
- Once you've used all 3, can't speak again until everyone has used theirs

**Virtual (Zoom):**
- Facilitator tracks participation on notepad
- "We haven't heard from [Name] yet—what are your thoughts?"

**Variation: Speaking Order:**
- Timekeeper cold-calls in round-robin order
- Prevents same people from always jumping in first

---

### When to Use

**Useful for:**
- Groups with significant power dynamics (senior/junior LPs)
- Cultures where deference is norm (need structure to override)
- Persistent domination issues despite other interventions

**Not Needed If:**
- Participation is already balanced
- Group has strong self-regulation norms
- Time is very limited (equity sticks add process overhead)

---

## Tool 9: "Think-Pair-Share" for Complex Questions

### Purpose
Give individual processing time before group discussion. Prevents "first idea wins."

### The Process

**Step 1: THINK (2 min, silent)**
Facilitator poses question: "Should the LP honor all commitments even if it violates policy?"
Everyone writes individual response (no talking).

**Step 2: PAIR (5 min)**
Turn to one partner. Share your thinking. Listen to theirs.

**Step 3: SHARE (8 min, full group)**
Partners share their conversation's highlights with full group.

---

### Why This Works

**Without think-time:**
- Fast thinkers dominate
- Slow processors don't contribute
- First idea often sticks (no exploration)

**With think-time:**
- Everyone forms an opinion
- Quality of contributions improves
- More diverse ideas surface

**When to Use:**
- Introducing a new, complex question
- After contentious debate (reset with individual thinking)
- When quieter members need processing time

---

## Putting It All Together: A Scaffolded Discussion

**Example: Touchpoint #2 (Stakeholder Analysis)**

1. **Assign Roles** (Tool 1: Role Cards)
   - Distribute Analyst, Devil's Advocate, Synthesizer, Timekeeper cards

2. **Set Protocol** (Tool 2: Discussion Protocol)
   - Display 5 phases on screen with timing

3. **Provide Question Stems** (Tool 3)
   - Print on worksheet: "Use these to guide your analysis"

4. **Model Constructive Challenge** (Tool 7)
   - Facilitator demos sentence starters at start

5. **Monitor Quality** (Tool 6: Checklist)
   - Facilitator observes, intervenes if red flags

6. **Manage Tangents** (Tool 5: Parking Lot)
   - Visible Google Doc for off-topic ideas

7. **Peer Feedback** (Tool 4: Rubric)
   - Used in post-session reflection

**Result:** Structured, high-quality discussion with clear expectations and support for participation.

## Common Facilitator Questions

**Q: What if learners resist structure ("This feels forced")?**
**A:** Explain the "why": "These tools ensure everyone contributes and we go deep. We'll relax structure once you've built good discussion habits."

**Q: Do I use ALL tools ALL the time?**
**A:** No. Choose based on needs:
- New group → More structure (roles, protocol, sentence starters)
- Experienced group → Less structure (just question stems, quality checklist)

**Q: What if a group ignores their roles?**
**A:** Check in: "Timekeeper, how's time? Devil's Advocate, what assumptions are we making?" Prompt them to USE their roles.

**Q: What if discussions are still superficial despite scaffolds?**
**A:** Raise the bar. "I'm hearing opinions, not evidence. Everyone find one exhibit that supports your point, then continue." Require higher standards.

## Connection to Other Artifacts

- **Peer Learning Protocol** (`peer-learning-protocol.md`): These scaffolds are USED at each touchpoint
- **Facilitator Guide** (`facilitator-guide.md`): When and how to deploy these tools
- **Assessment Rubric** (`assessment-rubric.md`): Peer contribution dimension evaluates quality behaviors these tools promote

---

## Final Note

**Scaffolding isn't "hand-holding"—it's enabling high performance.** Just as architects use scaffolding to build complex structures, we use these tools to build complex thinking. The goal is NOT permanent dependency, but building capacity. Over time, learners internalize these practices and need less explicit structure.

**The sweet spot:** Enough scaffold to ensure productive discussions, not so much that it feels mechanical. Adjust based on your group's maturity.
