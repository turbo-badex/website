# SME Collaboration Workflow
## How Instructional Designers Work with Subject Matter Experts
**Purpose:** Document the realistic, iterative process of developing case-based learning with SME partners

---

## Overview: The ID + SME Partnership

### The Fundamental Tension (and opportunity):
- **SME brings:** Domain expertise, real-world scenarios, credibility, nuanced understanding
- **ID brings:** Learning science, pedagogical structure, clarity of objectives, learner advocacy

**The magic happens when:**
- SME provides authenticity
- ID ensures learning effectiveness
- Together they create cases that are BOTH realistic AND teachable

```

---

## Phase 1: Learning Need Identification
### ID Responsibilities:

**Gather evidence of learning need:**
- ILPA member feedback ("LPs struggle with crisis decision-making")
- Industry trends (2022 denominator effect was widespread)
- Gap analysis (what's not covered in current curriculum?)
- Stakeholder input (what do hiring managers wish LPs knew?)

**Define learning objectives FIRST:**
- What should learners be able to DO after this case?
- What level of Bloom's taxonomy? (analysis, evaluation, synthesis)
- Why is case-based learning the right format? (vs. lecture, simulation, etc.)

**Create initial case concept:**
- 1-page overview: topic, learning objectives, why it matters
- Get buy-in from ILPA leadership before investing SME time

**Output:** Case concept brief (internal document)

---

## Phase 2: SME Recruitment & Onboarding
### ID Responsibilities:

**Identify ideal SME profile:**
- For denominator effect case: LP practitioner who experienced 2022 crisis firsthand
- Credibility in LP community
- Able to communicate complex ideas clearly
- Available for ~8-10 hours over 4 weeks

**Recruitment outreach:**
- Clear ask: "I need your expertise to create realistic case study"
- Time commitment transparency
- Compensation (if applicable)
- Value proposition: "Your insights will train next generation of LPs"

**Onboarding conversation (30 min):**
- Explain difference between SME role vs. ID role
- Show sample case structure
- Clarify: "I'm not asking you to teach—I'm asking you to provide realism"
- Set expectations: "I'll be asking you to simplify and add ambiguity (I know this feels backwards!)"

**Output:** SME agrees to partnership, timeline established

---

## Phase 3: Case Design Brief Creation
### ID Responsibilities:

**Write detailed design brief** (see case-design-brief.md artifact)

**Key sections:**
1. Learning objectives (SME needs to know what learners must practice)
2. Required "messiness" specifications
   - What information should be incomplete?
   - What stakeholders should conflict?
   - What should have no clear right answer?
3. Structural requirements (opening hook, exhibits, decision point)
4. Constraints (length, reading time, prerequisite knowledge)

**Why this matters:**
- Without clear brief, SME will write what's interesting (not what's pedagogically useful)
- Design brief is the "contract" between ID and SME

**Deliver brief to SME with:**
- 30-minute walkthrough (don't just send PDF)
- Q&A time
- Examples of "good" vs. "bad" case characteristics

**Output:** SME understands requirements and is ready to draft

---

## Phase 4: SME Case Drafting
### SME Responsibilities:

**Draft case content based on design brief:**
- Opening scene (dramatic moment)
- Background context (organization, portfolio history)
- The crisis (denominator effect details)
- Stakeholder perspectives (board, GPs, beneficiaries)
- Options analysis (4 choices with pros/cons)
- Exhibits (tables, cash flow projections, policies)

**ID responsibilities during this phase:**
- Check in after 1 week: "How's it going? Any questions?"
- Provide quick feedback on partial draft if requested
- Resist urge to take over writing (this is SME's domain)

**Common SME challenges:**
- "I want to include EVERYTHING" (comprehensiveness bias)
- "I'm not sure what to leave out" (need ID guidance)
- "Is this realistic enough?" (seeking validation)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for SME to draft (with 1-2 check-ins)

**Output:** SME provides draft case (~8-12 pages)

---

## Phase 5: ID Review for Learning Effectiveness
### ID Responsibilities:

**Review draft through LEARNING lens (not realism lens):**

**Questions to ask:**
1. **Clarity:** Can learners understand this without a PhD in finance?
2. **Focus:** Does every detail serve the learning objectives?
3. **Messiness:** Is the decision truly ambiguous, or is there an obvious answer?
4. **Engagement:** Will learners care about these characters/stakes?
5. **Time:** Can this be read in 30 minutes?

**Common ID feedback to SME:**

✅ **Good feedback:**
- "The portfolio math in Exhibit A is very realistic, but learners will get stuck on calculations instead of strategy. Can we simplify to 3 asset classes instead of 8?"
- "The decision feels too obvious—Option 2 is clearly best. Can we add conflicting data about GP track record to make it harder?"
- "The board chair's perspective is compelling, but we need more tension with the CIO. What would they really say to each other in a crisis?"

❌ **Bad feedback:**
- "This isn't realistic" (that's the SME's expertise, not yours)
- "You should include X detail" (unless it serves learning objective)
- "Can you rewrite this section?" (too directive, doesn't explain why)

**Create feedback document:**
- Use comment/suggestion mode (not directive edits)
- Explain WHY each change matters for learning
- Prioritize: "Must change" vs. "Nice to have"

**Timeline:** 3-5 days for ID to review and provide feedback

**Output:** Annotated draft with ID feedback

---

## Phase 6: Collaborative Iteration
### Equal Partnership Phase:

**Schedule live working session (60-90 min):**
- Walk through ID feedback together
- SME reacts, explains rationale, proposes alternatives
- ID clarifies learning objectives, constraints
- Together make trade-off decisions

**Sample dialogue from working session:**

---

### Example: Negotiating Complexity

**ID:** "In Exhibit A, the portfolio allocation table has 15 asset classes. I'm worried learners will get lost in the weeds. Can we simplify?"

**SME:** "But that's how real LP portfolios look! If we only show 3 asset classes, it's not realistic."

**ID:** "I agree it's realistic. My concern is the learning objective is about *crisis decision-making*, not portfolio construction. If they spend 20 minutes decoding the table, they won't have time to analyze stakeholder trade-offs."

**SME:** "Fair point. What if we simplify to 5 categories: Public Equity, Fixed Income, Private Equity, Real Assets, and Cash? That's still realistic but more digestible."

**ID:** "Perfect! That maintains realism while keeping focus on the decision. Can we also add a footnote like 'Portfolio simplified for instructional purposes—real allocations have 15+ categories'?"

**SME:** "Yes, that works. Preserves my credibility too."

**Outcome:** Compromise that serves both realism AND learning effectiveness.

---

### Example: Adding Messiness

**ID:** "After reading through all 4 options, Option 2 (negotiate GP commitments) seems like the clear winner. The case needs more ambiguity."

**SME:** "Interesting—when I lived through this in 2022, Option 2 actually WAS the right call."

**ID:** "That's great for real life, but for learning we need tension. What would make Option 2 riskier?"

**SME:** "Well, if the GP we need to renegotiate with is also our best-performing relationship, that changes the calculus. Damaging that relationship could cost us access to their next fund."

**ID:** "Perfect! Can we add that detail? Maybe a paragraph about the GP's track record and the risk of being shut out?"

**SME:** "Sure. I'll add a section about the specific GP (anonymized, but based on real firm)."

**ID:** "And we could add conflicting advice—maybe the investment team says 'don't risk the relationship' but the CFO says 'we have no choice, we're overcommitted.'"

**SME:** "Exactly what happened. I'll write both perspectives."

**Outcome:** Case now has genuine tension and no obvious answer.

---

### Example: Cutting Content

**ID:** "The historical background section on how the portfolio was built over 20 years is fascinating, but it's 3 pages. Learners need to read the case in 30 minutes."

**SME:** "But they need that context to understand why the portfolio is structured this way!"

**ID:** "What's the minimum context they need to make the decision? What if we cut it to 3 paragraphs and put the rest in an appendix for curious learners?"

**SME:** "Hmm. They really just need to know: (1) portfolio was built conservatively, (2) policy says 25% max in private markets, (3) board is risk-averse. That's... yeah, 3 paragraphs."

**ID:** "Exactly. The appendix can have the full history for depth, but not required reading."

**SME:** "Okay, I'll cut it. But I'm adding a footnote pointing to the appendix."

**ID:** "Deal."

**Outcome:** Case is now 9 pages instead of 12, more focused.

---

**Key patterns in negotiation:**
- ID explains *why* (learning objectives, cognitive load, time)
- SME explains *what* (realism, nuance, credibility)
- Together find compromise that serves both goals
- ID defers to SME on domain accuracy
- SME defers to ID on pedagogical structure

**After working session:**
- SME revises case based on agreed changes (1 week)
- ID reviews revision (2 days)
- If needed: 1 more iteration round
- Usually 2-3 iterations to final version

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for iteration cycles

**Output:** Final case draft that is BOTH realistic AND teachable

---

## Phase 7: Learning Architecture Design
### ID Responsibilities:

**Now ID builds learning structure around case:**
- Peer learning protocol (when/how learners interact)
- Discussion scaffolds (roles, question stems, rubrics)
- Facilitator guide (how to run session)
- Assessment rubric (individual + peer evaluation)
- Implementation guide (deployment logistics)

**SME role in this phase:**
- Review for realism: "Would real LPs talk about it this way?"
- Provide insights: "In real crisis, the CFO would present to board first, then open discussion"
- Validate assessment: "These rubric criteria are what I'd look for in a junior LP's analysis"

**Why SME review matters here:**
- Ensures discussion questions are grounded in real LP practice
- Validates that assessment criteria match industry standards
- Catches jargon or concepts that need explanation

**ID sends SME:**
- Draft facilitator guide + discussion scaffolds
- SME provides feedback (30-min review)
- ID incorporates SME insights

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for ID to design architecture + SME review

**Output:** Complete instructional package (9 artifacts)

---

## Common Friction Points & How to Navigate

### Friction Point 1: "SME wants to include everything"
**Why it happens:** SMEs think more detail = better learning
**How to handle:**
- Redirect to learning objectives: "Does this detail help learners practice crisis decision-making?"
- Offer appendix option: "Let's put deep dives in supplemental materials"
- Show data: "Research shows cases over 10 pages have 40% lower completion rates"

---

### Friction Point 2: "SME thinks ID is dumbing it down"
**Why it happens:** SMEs conflate simplification with oversimplification
**How to handle:**
- Validate expertise: "This is precisely why I need you—I can't fake this realism"
- Explain cognitive load: "Learners can hold 5-7 concepts in working memory at once"
- Show examples: "Here's a Harvard Business School case—notice how they simplify too?"

---

### Friction Point 3: "SME provides perfect information"
**Why it happens:** SMEs want to be helpful, so they answer every question in the case
**How to handle:**
- Explain ambiguity is intentional: "Real crises don't have all the data either"
- Ask: "What information did you NOT have when you faced this decision?"
- Frame it as realism: "The messiness IS the realistic part"

---

### Friction Point 4: "SME writes academically, not narratively"
**Why it happens:** SMEs think "educational" means formal/dry
**How to handle:**
- Ask for story: "Tell me what happened like you'd tell a colleague over coffee"
- Record conversation and transcribe: "Just talk me through it, I'll write it up"
- Show model: "Here's a case with great narrative voice—can we aim for this tone?"

---

### Friction Point 5: "SME gets defensive about feedback"
**Why it happens:** Feedback feels like criticism of their expertise
**How to handle:**
- Praise first: "This is incredibly realistic and well-informed"
- Frame feedback as YOUR limitation: "I need to simplify because learners don't have your expertise"
- Ask for help: "Can you help me figure out how to make this clearer for novices?"
- Never say "this is wrong" (say "I'm worried learners will miss this")

---

## Tips for Maintaining Productive SME Relationships

### 1. **Set clear expectations upfront**
   - Time commitment
   - Number of revision rounds
   - What "done" looks like

### 2. **Acknowledge their expertise constantly**
   - "This detail is fascinating—only someone who lived this would know"
   - "Your insights are elevating this case"

### 3. **Explain your decisions with learning science**
   - "Research shows learners need concrete examples to transfer learning"
   - "Cognitive load theory suggests we limit to 3 options"

### 4. **Offer examples and models**
   - Show SME what "good" looks like
   - Provide templates and structures

### 5. **Be flexible within constraints**
   - Let SME have wins on things that don't impact learning
   - "You're right, let's keep that detail—it adds richness"

### 6. **Thank them publicly**
   - Case attribution: "Developed in collaboration with [SME name], LP at [institution]"
   - Ask if they want to present case at first delivery
   - Share positive learner feedback with them

## Balancing Realism vs. Learning Effectiveness

**The ID's guiding principle:**
> "Realistic enough to be credible, simplified enough to teach"

### When to prioritize realism:
- Core decision structure (these are really the options)
- Stakeholder motivations (this is truly what board cares about)
- Industry terminology (learners need to learn the language)

### When to prioritize learning:
- Complexity reduction (fewer asset classes, shorter timeframes)
- Information ambiguity (deliberately leave data incomplete)
- Narrative clarity (add dramatic hook even if "real" situation was boring)

### The test:
- Would a learner who completes this case be BETTER prepared for real-world LP decision-making?
- If yes → good balance
- If learners would be confused or overwhelmed → simplify more
- If learners would breeze through with no challenge → add complexity

## Measuring Success of ID + SME Collaboration

**You'll know the collaboration worked when:**

✅ SME says: "I learned something about how people learn from this process"

✅ Learners say: "This case felt realistic—I could see myself in this situation"

✅ SME volunteers to develop another case with you (relationship maintained)

✅ ID can confidently say: "This case achieves the learning objectives"

✅ Both parties feel ownership: "We created this together"

**What I'm asking:**
- 8-10 hours over 4 weeks
- Help develop a realistic case scenario based on your LP experience
- Review learning materials for authenticity

**What you'd gain:**
- [Compensation if applicable]
- Case attribution and visibility in LP community
- Opportunity to shape how next generation of LPs is trained

**Next step:**
30-minute exploratory call to discuss the project and see if it's a good fit.

Are you interested?

[Your name]
```

### Template 2: Feedback on SME draft

```
Hi [SME name],

Thank you for the comprehensive draft—your insights on the denominator effect are exactly what we need to make this case realistic and compelling.

I've reviewed the draft through a learning effectiveness lens and provided feedback in the attached document. My comments fall into three categories:

**1. Clarification requests (green):** Places where I need more context to understand

**2. Simplification suggestions (yellow):** Areas where I'm worried about cognitive overload for learners

**3. Messiness additions (orange):** Opportunities to add ambiguity and tension

**Key theme:** Your draft is highly realistic (which is great!), and now we need to calibrate the complexity for learners who have 30 minutes to read it and 2 hours to analyze it.

Can we schedule a 60-min working session next week to walk through these together? I want to understand your thinking and find solutions that preserve realism while hitting our learning objectives.

[Your name]
```

---

### Template 3: Closing thank you

```
Hi [SME name],

We just completed the first delivery of the Denominator Effect case, and I wanted to share the learner feedback with you:

- 92% said the case felt realistic and relevant
- "The stakeholder tensions felt exactly like what we face in our portfolio" - LP from major pension fund
- "This was the most valuable case discussion I've had in my career" - Emerging LP

None of this would have been possible without your expertise and patience through our iteration cycles. Your willingness to simplify Exhibit A and add the GP relationship tension made all the difference.

I'd love to collaborate on future cases if you're open to it. And if you're ever interested in guest-facilitating a session, learners would benefit enormously from hearing directly from you.

Thank you again.

[Your name]
```
