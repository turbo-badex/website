# Implementation Guide
## The Denominator Effect Dilemma Case Study
**Purpose:** Practical deployment plan for ILPA Institute context

---

## Timeline Overview

### Total Time Commitment: 3.5 hours
- **Pre-work (Asynchronous):** 1 hour
- **Live Session (Synchronous):** 2 hours
- **Post-work (Asynchronous):** 30 minutes

---

## Pre-Work Phase (1 Hour, Asynchronous)

### What Learners Do:
1. **Read the case** (30 min)
   - Full case narrative
   - All exhibits (portfolio tables, policy excerpts, cash flow projections)
   - Stakeholder perspectives

2. **Individual analysis** (20 min)
   - Complete Preliminary Analysis Worksheet
   - Calculate portfolio implications
   - List pros/cons for each option

3. **Initial stance posting** (10 min)
   - Post recommendation to LMS discussion board (150-200 words)
   - Must post BEFORE seeing peer responses (prevents anchoring)

### Technology Requirements:
- **LMS capability needed:** Discussion board with "post before viewing" setting
- **File distribution:** Case PDF + Excel exhibits downloadable
- **Worksheet:** Fillable PDF or Google Doc template

### ID Preparation:
- Upload case materials 1 week before live session
- Send reminder email 3 days before with instructions
- Monitor discussion board to ensure all learners post before session

---

## Live Session Phase (2 Hours, Synchronous)

### Technology Requirements:
- **Video conferencing:** Zoom/Teams with breakout room capability
- **Collaborative tools:**
  - Miro/Mural board for Gallery Walk (or physical poster boards if in-person)
  - Google Doc for shared note-taking
- **Roles:** Facilitator + optional Teaching Assistant (for 20+ learners)

### Session Flow:

#### Segment 1: Opening & Orientation (10 min)
**What happens:**
- Facilitator reviews learning objectives
- Poll: "What's your current recommendation?" (see distribution)
- Preview of session structure

**Facilitator prep:**
- Pre-create breakout rooms (4 people each)
- Assign stakeholder perspectives to each group
- Prepare poll questions in Zoom

---

#### Segment 2: Small Group Stakeholder Deep Dive (30 min)
**What happens:**
- Breakout rooms (4 people per group)
- Each group analyzes ONE stakeholder perspective deeply
- Groups use Stakeholder Analysis Template (provided)

**Facilitator moves:**
- Visit each breakout room once (5 min)
- Use Discussion Quality Checklist (from facilitator guide)
- Give 10-min, 5-min, 2-min warnings

**Technology:**
- Breakout rooms with shared Google Doc per group
- Timer visible to all groups

---

#### Segment 3: Gallery Walk (30 min)
**What happens:**
- Groups present stakeholder analysis (3 min each)
- Other groups challenge assumptions using Challenge Cards
- Facilitator synthesizes patterns

**Facilitator moves:**
- Enforce time limits strictly
- Capture cross-group insights on shared board
- Highlight contradictions between stakeholder views

**Technology:**
- Screen share for virtual (groups present their docs)
- Physical poster boards for in-person
- Facilitator uses shared Miro board to map tensions

---

#### Segment 4: Individual Reflection & Revision (15 min)
**What happens:**
- Silent individual work
- Learners revise their initial recommendation
- Must explicitly note what changed and why

**Facilitator moves:**
- Enforce silence (no questions during this time)
- Display reflection prompts on screen
- Circulate (in-person) or monitor chat (virtual)

**Technology:**
- Learners work in personal Google Doc
- Submit via LMS at end of segment

---

#### Segment 5: Board Defense (30 min)
**What happens:**
- 5-6 learners volunteer to present recommendation
- Other learners role-play board members (using Board Member Cards)
- Facilitator debriefs patterns

**Facilitator moves:**
- Select diverse recommendations (not all the same choice)
- Ensure questioners are respectful but challenging
- Synthesize what makes a strong defense

**Technology:**
- Presenters unmute/come on camera
- Board members use chat or raise hand to question
- Facilitator controls speaking order

---

#### Segment 6: Debrief & Transfer (15 min)
**What happens:**
- Facilitator leads structured debrief
- Connect case to real LP practice
- Preview post-work assignment

**Facilitator questions:**
- "What surprised you about peer perspectives?"
- "How did your thinking evolve from initial stance?"
- "What would you do differently in a real crisis?"

---

## Post-Work Phase (30 Minutes, Asynchronous)

### What Learners Do:
1. **Final recommendation memo** (20 min)
   - 1-page memo to board
   - Must reference peer insights that influenced thinking
   - Graded using Individual Analysis Rubric

2. **Peer contribution reflection** (10 min)
   - Self-assess using Peer Learning Rubric
   - Submit evidence of contributions (quotes from discussion)

### Technology Requirements:
- LMS assignment submission
- Rubric visible to learners before submission

### ID Grading:
- Individual analysis rubric (80% of grade)
- Peer contribution rubric (20% of grade)
- Provide feedback within 1 week

---

## Cohort Sizing Recommendations

### Ideal Cohort Size: 16-20 learners
**Why:**
- Creates 4-5 small groups of 4 people each
- Enough diversity of perspectives
- Manageable for facilitator to monitor

### Minimum Cohort Size: 12 learners
- 3 small groups of 4 people
- Risk: Less diversity of perspectives

### Maximum Cohort Size: 24 learners
- 6 small groups of 4 people
- Requires Teaching Assistant to support
- Gallery Walk becomes longer (may need to adjust timing)

### What if you have 30+ learners?
**Option A: Run multiple cohorts**
- 2 separate sessions with 15 learners each
- Best for learning quality

**Option B: Scale with breakout facilitators**
- Recruit 6 assistant facilitators (1 per breakout room)
- Train them on Discussion Quality Checklist
- Debrief is harder with this many voices

---

## Adaptation Options

### Fully Online (Synchronous Live Session)
**Pros:**
- Geographic flexibility
- Easy to record for absent learners
- Breakout rooms work well

**Cons:**
- Harder to read body language
- Technical issues can disrupt
- Gallery Walk less dynamic

**Tech stack:**
- Zoom/Teams (breakout rooms)
- Miro/Mural (collaborative board)
- LMS (pre/post work)

---

### Fully In-Person
**Pros:**
- Rich discussion dynamics
- Gallery Walk very engaging (physical movement)
- Easier to read room energy

**Cons:**
- Geographic limitations
- Scheduling harder
- Exhibit sharing requires printing

**Tech stack:**
- Projector for case exhibits
- Physical poster boards for Gallery Walk
- Printed role cards and scaffolds
- LMS still needed for pre/post work

---

### Hybrid (Some learners remote, some in-person)
**NOT RECOMMENDED for this case**

**Why:**
- Breakout rooms don't work well (in-person groups have advantage)
- Gallery Walk awkward (remote learners can't circulate)
- Peer dynamics suffer (remote learners feel like second-class participants)

**If you MUST do hybrid:**
- Ensure each breakout group has mix of remote + in-person
- Use dual screens (one for remote participants)
- Assign Teaching Assistant to monitor remote experience

---

### Asynchronous-Only Version
**Can this case work fully asynchronous?**
**Answer: Partially, but you lose 60% of the value**

**What you could do:**
- Pre-work: Same (read case, post initial stance)
- Discussion boards replace live session:
  - Threaded discussions by stakeholder
  - Require learners to respond to 3 peers
  - 1-week window for discussion
- Assessment: Same (final recommendation memo)

**What you LOSE:**
- Real-time dialogue and challenge
- Energy of board defense
- Facilitator ability to redirect and synthesize
- Spontaneous "aha" moments

**Recommendation:** Only use async version if live session is impossible. Consider making live session optional but incentivized.

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Scaling to Multiple Cohorts (e.g., ILPA offers this 10 times/year)

**Create once, run many times:**
- All materials are reusable (case, scaffolds, rubrics)
- Facilitator guide enables different facilitators to run consistently
- LMS setup can be cloned

**Continuous improvement:**
- After each cohort, review learner feedback
- Refine timing, scaffolds, facilitation moves
- Track which discussion questions work best

**Facilitator training needs:**
- New facilitators should observe 1 session before leading
- Provide Facilitator Certification checklist
- Debrief after first 2 sessions they lead

---

### Scaling to Different LP Audiences

**This case can be adapted for:**
- **LP junior staff:** Add more scaffolding, simplify exhibits
- **LP senior leadership:** Reduce scaffolding, add board politics complexity
- **GP audience:** Flip perspective (how would GP respond to LP in crisis?)
- **Consultants/advisors:** Add advisory recommendations layer

**What to change:**
- Prerequisite knowledge requirements
- Complexity of exhibits
- Depth of stakeholder analysis

**What stays the same:**
- Peer learning protocol structure
- Assessment approach
- Facilitation principles

---

## Technology Platform Requirements

### Minimum LMS Features Needed:
- [ ] Discussion boards with "post before viewing" option
- [ ] File distribution (PDF, Excel)
- [ ] Assignment submission
- [ ] Rubric display and grading
- [ ] Learner progress tracking

### Recommended LMS Platforms:
- **Canvas:** All features supported, excellent rubric integration
- **Moodle:** Works well, may need plugins for rubric display
- **Blackboard:** Supported, slightly clunky interface
- **Teachable/Kajabi:** NOT recommended (limited discussion features)

---

### Live Session Platform Requirements:
- [ ] Video conferencing (Zoom/Teams/Google Meet)
- [ ] Breakout rooms (auto-assign or manual)
- [ ] Screen sharing
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Recording capability
- [ ] Polls (nice to have)

---

### Collaborative Tools:
**For Gallery Walk:**
- **Option A:** Miro (best for visual mapping)
- **Option B:** Mural (similar to Miro)
- **Option C:** Google Jamboard (simpler, less features)
- **Option D:** PowerPoint slides (low-tech backup)

**For shared note-taking:**
- Google Docs (real-time collaboration)
- Microsoft Word online
- Notion (if learners already use it)

---

## Cost Considerations

### Free/Low-Cost Stack:
- **LMS:** Moodle (open-source) or Google Classroom
- **Live session:** Google Meet or Zoom Basic
- **Collaboration:** Google Docs + Jamboard
- **Total cost:** $0-$50/month

### Premium Stack:
- **LMS:** Canvas ($5-10k/year institutional)
- **Live session:** Zoom Pro ($150/year/license)
- **Collaboration:** Miro ($8-16/user/month)
- **Total cost:** ~$6k/year

### ILPA Context:
- Likely already has enterprise LMS
- Likely already has Zoom Pro licenses
- May need to add Miro licenses for facilitators

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### For learners with disabilities:

**Visual impairments:**
- Provide screen-reader compatible case materials
- Describe visual exhibits verbally during live session
- Offer extended time for pre-work

**Hearing impairments:**
- Live captioning for synchronous session
- Transcripts of all video content
- Written version of all verbal prompts

**Mobility impairments:**
- Ensure Gallery Walk can be done virtually (not just physical movement)
- All materials accessible via keyboard navigation

**Neurodivergent learners:**
- Provide session agenda in advance
- Allow processing time before calling on learners
- Offer alternative to live defense (written defense)

---

## Pilot Testing Plan

### Before full deployment, test with 3-5 LP practitioners:

**Week 1: Case review**
- SME provides case, ID provides design brief
- 3 beta testers read case, provide feedback
- Iterate based on: clarity, realism, time to read

**Week 2: Dry run of live session**
- Run full 2-hour session with beta testers
- Test all technology (breakout rooms, Miro board)
- ID observes timing, flow, engagement

**Week 3: Refinement**
- Review recording
- Survey beta testers (what worked, what didn't)
- Revise facilitation guide, scaffolds, timing

**Week 4: Final review**
- SME reviews revised case
- ID finalizes all materials
- Ready for production deployment

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Learners didn't do the pre-work"
**Prevention:**
- Send reminder email 3 days before
- Make pre-work posting worth 10% of grade
- In LMS, lock live session access until pre-work submitted

**If it happens anyway:**
- Give 15 min at start of session to read case (adjust timing)
- Skip Initial Stance Review (go straight to breakout)

---

### Issue 2: "Discussion stays surface-level"
**Facilitator interventions:**
- Use Question Stems from scaffolding tools
- Assign Devil's Advocate role explicitly
- Ask: "What assumptions are you making?"

---

### Issue 3: "One learner dominates discussion"
**Prevention:**
- Use Role Cards (everyone has equal speaking time)
- Speaking protocol (round-robin, not open discussion)

**If it happens anyway:**
- Facilitator privately messages dominant learner: "Great insights—can you help draw out quieter voices?"
- Assign them Synthesizer role (speaks last)

---

### Issue 4: "Groups finish breakout work too quickly"
**This means task wasn't complex enough:**
- Add follow-up question via facilitator broadcast
- Extend task: "Now challenge your own recommendation"

---

### Issue 5: "Technical issues disrupt session"
**Backup plan:**
- Have phone dial-in option for video conferencing
- Backup: Use LMS discussion boards if video fails
- Always have facilitator guide printed (not just digital)

---

## Post-Session Analytics to Track

### Learning effectiveness metrics:
- % learners who changed recommendation after peer learning (goal: >50%)
- Average assessment score on Individual Analysis Rubric (goal: >3.5/5)
- Learner self-reported confidence in decision-making (pre/post survey)

### Engagement metrics:
- % completion of pre-work (goal: >90%)
- % active participation in live session (goal: 100%)
- % submission of post-work (goal: >85%)

### Quality metrics:
- Learner satisfaction survey (goal: >4.2/5)
- "Would recommend to peer" (goal: >80% yes)
- SME review: "Case represents realistic LP challenge" (goal: 4.5/5)

---

## Continuous Improvement Process

**After each cohort:**
1. Review facilitator notes (what worked, what didn't)
2. Read 5-10 sample learner submissions (quality check)
3. Survey learners (standardized instrument)
4. Make 1-2 targeted improvements (don't change everything)

**After 3 cohorts:**
- Major review of case (still realistic? timely?)
- Update exhibits if needed (market data, policy changes)
- Refine scaffolds based on patterns

**Annual review:**
- Is denominator effect still relevant topic?
- Should case be retired or refreshed?
- Are there new case topics to develop?

---

## Success Indicators

**You'll know this implementation is successful when:**

✅ **Learners consistently report:** "I learned more from peers than from the case itself"

✅ **Facilitators report:** "The guide gave me everything I needed to run this well"

✅ **ILPA sees:** High enrollment in subsequent cohorts (word-of-mouth)

✅ **Assessment shows:** Learners can defend decisions under pressure (synthesis level)

✅ **Peers cite each other:** Final memos reference peer insights explicitly
