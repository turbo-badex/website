# Case Study Design Brief for SME
## The Denominator Effect Dilemma

**Project:** ILPA Institute Case-Based Learning Module
**Instructional Designer:** [Your Name]
**SME Collaborator:** [LP Practitioner Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Target Completion:** [4 weeks from kickoff]

## Purpose of This Brief

This brief provides clear requirements for developing a case study that achieves specific learning objectives. As the SME, your role is to provide **domain expertise, realism, and credibility**. My role as ID is to ensure the case serves **learning effectiveness**.

We'll iterate together to balance these priorities.

---

## Learning Context

**Audience:** Institutional LP professionals (foundations, endowments, pensions, sovereign wealth funds)
**Experience Level:** 3-10 years in LP role; familiar with portfolio construction and GP relationships
**Learning Format:** Blended (1 hour pre-work + 2-hour live peer discussion session)
**Prerequisite Knowledge:** Basic portfolio allocation concepts, understanding of private markets illiquidity

---

## Learning Objectives (What Learners Must DO)

By the end of this case-based module, learners will be able to:

1. **Analyze** portfolio crisis situations by evaluating trade-offs between policy compliance and performance objectives (Bloom's: Analysis)

2. **Evaluate** multiple stakeholder perspectives (board, beneficiaries, GPs, staff) and defend a recommendation that considers competing priorities (Bloom's: Evaluation)

3. **Synthesize** a crisis management approach that integrates quantitative analysis (portfolio math) with qualitative factors (relationships, reputation, risk) (Bloom's: Synthesis)

**Translation for case design:** The case must force learners to make a difficult decision with no obvious "right" answer, requiring them to balance numbers with judgment.

## Case Topic: The Denominator Effect Crisis

**Core Scenario:**
An institutional LP faces a portfolio crisis when public market declines cause their private markets allocation to jump from 25% (target) to 38% (overweight), while $500M in unfunded commitments to top-tier GPs are coming due in the next 12 months.

**The Dilemma:**
Every option has significant downsides:
- Honor all commitments → Goes further overweight, violates policy
- Default on commitments → Destroys GP relationships, reputation damage
- Sell secondaries → Realize losses at 60 cents on dollar, bad optics
- Negotiate reductions → Shows weakness, may damage re-up prospects

**Why this works pedagogically:**
- **Real-world relevance:** Every LP faced this post-2022; highly relatable
- **Quantitative + qualitative:** Requires both math and judgment
- **Multiple stakeholders:** Board, CIO, GPs, beneficiaries all have different views
- **Time pressure:** Forces decision-making under constraints
- **No perfect solution:** Ambiguity forces synthesis of competing priorities

---

## Required "Messiness" Specifications

For the case to achieve learning objectives, it MUST include these characteristics:

### 1. Incomplete Information (Real-World Ambiguity)
**What should be MISSING or UNCLEAR:**
- [ ] Uncertain market recovery timeline ("Could bounce back in 6 months... or not")
- [ ] GP response to commitment reductions unknown ("Would they understand? Retaliate?")
- [ ] Board's risk tolerance ambiguous (policy says one thing, informal conversations suggest flexibility)
- [ ] Beneficiary sentiment unclear (some may prioritize returns, others values/risk)

**Why:** Learners must practice deciding with imperfect data, like real LPs do

### 2. Competing Stakeholder Pressures
**Required perspectives (minimum 4):**
- [ ] **Board Investment Committee Chair:** Policy compliance is paramount, reputation matters
- [ ] **CIO/Investment Staff:** Relationships with GPs are long-term assets, don't want to burn bridges
- [ ] **Chief Financial Officer:** Cash flow crunch is real, operational constraints matter
- [ ] **GP Partners (external):** Commitments are commitments; suggest LP is overextended if can't honor

**Optional but helpful:**
- [ ] **Beneficiaries/Stakeholders:** Different views (retirees want safety vs. younger members want growth)
- [ ] **External Consultant/Board Member:** Outsider perspective

**Why:** Forces learners to empathize with multiple viewpoints, not just their own

### 3. Quantitative Complexity (But Not Overwhelming)
**Required exhibits:**
- [ ] **Portfolio Allocation Table:** Before/after public market decline showing denominator effect (with clear math showing how 25% became 38%)
- [ ] **Commitment Schedule:** Upcoming capital calls by GP and timing (next 12-24 months)
- [ ] **Cash Flow Projection:** Available liquidity vs. commitments due
- [ ] **Policy Excerpt:** What the investment policy actually says about allocation limits

**Constraints:**
- Keep math straightforward (addition, percentages, simple projections)
- No more than 3-4 exhibits total
- Each exhibit should fit on one page maximum
- Learners should be able to understand the numbers in 10-15 minutes

**Why:** Real LPs work with numbers, but this isn't a finance test—it's about decision-making

### 4. No Single "Correct" Answer
**How to create ambiguity:**
- [ ] Each option has legitimate pros and cons (no obvious winner)
- [ ] Reasonable LPs could disagree based on risk tolerance, values, or priorities
- [ ] Time horizon matters: short-term pain vs. long-term relationship preservation
- [ ] Context-dependent: what's right for one organization may not be for another

**Red flags to avoid:**
- One option that's clearly superior to all others
- A "gotcha" where learners should realize there's a hidden third option
- Moral absolutes (this is business judgment, not ethics)

**Why:** Messy cases force synthesis and defense, not just finding the "right" answer

---

## Structural Requirements

### Opening Hook (Dramatic Moment)
**What I need from you:**
A scene that immediately conveys urgency and tension. Ideally:
- A meeting or phone call where the crisis becomes clear
- Specific dialogue showing stakeholder conflict
- Emotional weight (stress, frustration, pressure)

**Example structure:**
> "It was 9 AM on Monday, November 7th, when CFO Sarah Martinez walked into the Investment Committee meeting with numbers no one wanted to see..."

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs maximum

---

### Background Context (Just Enough)
**What I need from you:**
- Organization type and size (e.g., "$8B university endowment")
- Portfolio history (how they got to 25% PE allocation)
- Key GP relationships (2-3 examples of important partnerships)
- Previous portfolio performance (to show this isn't typical mismanagement)

**What to avoid:**
- Exhaustive history of the institution
- Detailed biographies of characters
- Tangential information about the market crash

**Length:** 2-3 pages maximum

---

### The Crisis Details
**What I need from you:**
- Specific numbers: portfolio value before/after, allocation percentages, commitment amounts
- Timeline: when did this happen, when are decisions due
- What triggered the board's attention (audit? consultant report? media coverage?)

**Length:** 1-2 pages

---

### Stakeholder Perspectives (3-4 Required)
**For each stakeholder, include:**
- Their title and role
- Their primary concern about the situation
- What they're advocating for (which option they prefer)
- Their reasoning (why they think it's best)
- One quote that captures their view

**Format:**
> **Board Chair Robert Chen:**
> "We have a fiduciary duty to follow our own policy. If we violate allocation limits, what's the policy even for? We need to get back to 25%, whatever it takes."

**Length:** 1/2 page per stakeholder

---

### Options Analysis
**What I need from you:** 4 options with realistic pros/cons for each

**For each option, provide:**
- Clear description of what it would entail
- 3-4 pros (why an LP might choose this)
- 3-4 cons (risks, downsides, tradeoffs)
- Rough cost/impact estimate if applicable

**Example:**
> **Option 1: Honor All Commitments**
> *Go to 40%+ PE allocation, violate policy for 2-3 years until distributions rebalance*
> - **Pros:** Preserve GP relationships, show commitment, avoid realized losses
> - **Cons:** Policy violation, board/stakeholder concern, concentration risk, precedent issue

**Length:** 1 page total (4 options × 1/4 page each)

---

### Exhibits (3-4 Required)

**Exhibit A: Portfolio Allocation Impact**
```
                    Jan 2022        Nov 2022       Target
Public Equities     $4.8B (60%)    $3.2B (46%)    60%
Private Equity      $2.0B (25%)    $2.6B (38%)    25%
Fixed Income        $1.0B (12.5%)  $0.9B (13%)    12.5%
Other               $0.2B (2.5%)   $0.2B (3%)     2.5%
TOTAL               $8.0B          $6.9B
```

**Exhibit B: Commitment Schedule (Next 12 Months)**
- [List of 8-10 GPs with commitment amounts and expected call timing]

**Exhibit C: Cash Flow Projection**
- [Available liquidity vs. commitments due]

**Exhibit D: Investment Policy Excerpt**
- [Relevant section about allocation limits and rebalancing procedures]

**Format guidance:** Simple tables, clear labels, one page per exhibit maximum

---

### The Decision Prompt (Ending)
**What I need from you:**
A clear statement of what learners must decide and by when.

**Example:**
> "The Investment Committee meets again in two weeks. You've been asked to prepare a recommendation: Which path should the endowment take? What will you recommend, and how will you defend it?"

**Length:** 1 paragraph

---

## Constraints & Logistics

- **Total case length:** 8-12 pages (including exhibits)
- **Reading time:** 45-60 minutes for first pass
- **Tone:** Professional but accessible; avoid jargon where possible
- **Format:** Will be provided as PDF to learners
- **Anonymization:** If based on real scenario, please anonymize institution name, characters, specific GPs

---

## What Happens After You Draft the Case

### My Review (ID Perspective)
I'll review the draft for:
- **Learning effectiveness:** Does it achieve the 3 learning objectives?
- **Appropriate messiness:** Is it complex enough but not overwhelming?
- **Stakeholder balance:** Are all perspectives given fair weight?
- **Feasibility:** Can learners engage with this in the time available?

### Example Feedback You Might Receive
- "This is excellent and realistic, but the math in Exhibit A is too complex—can we simplify to just percentages and totals?"
- "The decision feels too obvious toward Option 2—can we add conflicting data about GP X's recent performance to make it more ambiguous?"
- "Board Chair Chen's perspective is clear, but we're missing the CFO's operational/cash flow concerns—can you add that?"

### Iteration Process
- I'll provide specific, actionable feedback (not just "make it messier")
- We'll have 1-2 review cycles (typically 2-week turnaround)
- Final case will be tested with 3-5 pilot learners before wide release

## Questions for Our Kickoff Meeting

Before you start drafting, let's discuss:

1. **Based on your experience, which GPs tend to be most/least flexible about commitment reductions?** (This will help create realistic stakeholder perspectives)

2. **In real denominator effect situations you've seen, what were the most painful trade-offs?** (This will help ensure authentic tension)

3. **What data/exhibits would a real LP Investment Committee need to make this decision?** (This ensures realism in our quantitative components)

4. **Are there any "third rail" issues in the LP community I should be aware of?** (Sensitivities around defaults, GP relationships, etc.)

## Contact & Collaboration

**Instructional Designer:** [Your contact info]
**Preferred communication:** [Email, Slack, Zoom]
**Working style:** I'll provide structured feedback via Google Docs comments, with a 30-minute Zoom call to discuss if needed

**What I need from you:**
- Draft case narrative + exhibits by [date]
- Openness to iteration (this rarely gets perfect on first draft)
- Willingness to simplify for learning effectiveness (even if it loses some realism)

**What you can expect from me:**
- Clear, specific feedback (not vague "make it better" requests)
- Respect for your domain expertise
- Focus on learning effectiveness, not trying to be the LP expert

---

## Why This Collaboration Matters

Great case-based learning requires **both domain expertise (you) and instructional design (me)**:

- **You bring:** Realism, credibility, nuance, industry insight
- **I bring:** Learning objectives, scaffolding, assessment design, facilitation planning

Together, we'll create a case that LP practitioners recognize as real AND helps them develop crisis decision-making skills.

## Appendix: Case Design Principles

**Good case studies are:**
- ✅ Problem-centered (not information dumps)
- ✅ Ambiguous (no obvious right answer)
- ✅ Time-bound (decisions have deadlines)
- ✅ Multi-stakeholder (competing perspectives)
- ✅ Consequential (decisions matter)

**Case studies to avoid:**
- ❌ Thinly veiled "guess what we did" stories
- ❌ Theory heavy (save that for lectures)
- ❌ Too many variables (learners get lost)
- ❌ Requiring specialized knowledge (should be accessible to target audience)
- ❌ Moral absolutes (business judgment, not ethics)
