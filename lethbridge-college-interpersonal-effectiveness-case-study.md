## The Challenge

### Educational Problem: Teaching Soft Skills Through Concrete Examples

Lethbridge College's Student Success department needed an effective way to teach interpersonal communication skills—specifically the seven-step communication framework technique from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)—to help students navigate challenging academic conversations with confidence and professionalism.

**The Learning Gap:**

**Current State:**
- Students lacked concrete examples of how to approach difficult conversations with instructors
- Many avoided addressing academic concerns due to fear of confrontation or uncertainty about appropriate communication
- Abstract descriptions of communication frameworks (seven-step communication framework acronym) didn't translate to real-world application
- Students struggled to balance assertiveness with respect in power-imbalanced situations (student-instructor dynamic)

**Desired State:**
- Students understand each component of the seven-step communication framework framework through observable behavior
- Students can recognize effective communication strategies in context
- Students feel empowered to advocate for themselves professionally
- Students can apply the framework to similar academic situations (grade discussions, extensions, accommodations)

**Root Cause:** Students needed to see the framework in action, not just memorized. The challenge wasn't information delivery—it was modeling professional advocacy behavior in a realistic, relatable scenario.

### Audience Challenges: Diverse Student Population

**Audience Profile:**
- **Demographics:** Ages 18-35+, diverse cultural backgrounds, varying communication confidence levels
- **Context:** Students experiencing academic stress, grade concerns, time constraints
- **Attitude:** Some anxiety around instructor interactions, desire for practical guidance
- **Learning Preference:** Visual learners, scenario-based examples, short-form content compatible with social media consumption habits

**Instructional Challenge:**
The animation needed to demonstrate assertive communication without appearing confrontational, show vulnerability without weakness, and model professionalism in a situation many students find intimidating—all within 2-3 minutes.

## Process & Methodology

### Needs Analysis & Concept Development

**1. Framework Integration**
I worked with Lethbridge College stakeholders to understand the seven-step communication framework communication framework and how it applies to common student scenarios:
- **D**escribe the situation (facts, not judgments)
- **E**xpress clearly (feelings and opinions)
- **A**ssert wishes (specific requests)
- **R**einforce (positive outcomes for all parties)
- **S**tay mindful (focus on goals)
- **A**ppear confident (tone, posture, language)
- **N**egotiate (find middle ground)

**2. Scenario Selection**
Through consultation with Student Success advisors, we identified the grade discussion scenario as highly relatable and commonly anxiety-inducing. The situation needed to demonstrate:
- Student experiencing legitimate academic concerns (vague test questions, instructor unavailability, unanswered emails)
- Professional tone despite frustration
- Clear problem description without blaming
- Specific, reasonable solution proposal
- Positive resolution through collaborative problem-solving

**3. Character & Visual Design Decisions**
- **Character Design:** Approachable, diverse, relatable student and instructor characters with neutral styling to maximize identification across demographics
- **Setting:** Simple office environment—recognizable but not distracting from dialogue
- **Visual Style:** Clean, friendly illustration style with hand-drawn warmth to reduce formality and intimidation

### Storyboard Development

**Strategic Scene Breakdown:**

**Opening Frame (Scene 01):**
- **Purpose:** Orient learners to the framework before dialogue begins
- **Visual Strategy:** Split-screen showing full seven-step communication framework acronym on left (color-coded for each step) with characters on right
- **Audio:** Upbeat, approachable music to reduce anxiety around "difficult conversation" framing
- **Why This Works:** Learners see the roadmap before the scenario, priming them to notice each technique as it appears

**Introduction & Describe (Scenes 02-04):**
- **Student opens with gratitude and respect:** "Hi Emily, thank you for agreeing to meet with me..."
- **Zoom technique:** Camera moves from wide to medium shot, focusing attention on interpersonal dynamics
- **"DESCRIBE" text reveal:** Punctuates the transition to problem description
- **Factual problem statement:** Student lists specific issues (vague questions, unanswered emails, instructor unavailability) without accusatory language
- **Instructor validation:** "I take your points" shows receptiveness to professional communication

**Visual Teaching Strategy:**
Each seven-step communication framework component appears as on-screen text at the moment the character demonstrates it, creating immediate connection between framework and behavior. This dual-channel learning (visual text + character dialogue) reinforces the "what" and "how" simultaneously.

### Animation Approach: Humanizing Professional Communication

**Character Animation Choices:**
- **Lip sync and hand gestures:** Creating realistic, natural movement makes the scenario feel authentic rather than scripted
- **Body language consistency:** Student maintains respectful posture while showing appropriate concern; instructor displays open, receptive positioning
- **Facial expressions:** Subtle emotional cues (student's slight nervousness, instructor's thoughtful consideration) add humanity without melodrama

**Pacing Strategy:**
- Conversation unfolds at natural speaking pace (not rushed)
- Camera movements (pan up to reveal text, zoom in/out) create visual rhythm and guide attention
- Music fades down during dialogue to prioritize comprehension while maintaining emotional tone

## Design Decisions & Solutions

### Storytelling for Behavior Modeling

**Authentic Scenario Design:**
The scenario reflects real student frustrations (instructor communication gaps, test fairness concerns, environmental disruptions like construction noise) to establish immediate relevance. By giving the student legitimate grievances, the animation validates student experiences while demonstrating professional response strategies.

**Solution Arc:**
- **Problem → Process → Resolution structure** shows that the framework works—the student gets a positive outcome (retake offer extended to all students) through professional advocacy
- **Teacher's receptiveness** demonstrates that respectful communication is more likely to be heard than confrontational approaches
- **Fairness consideration** (retake offered to all students, not just the complainer) models ethical thinking and consideration of peer equity

### Visual Information Architecture

**Color-Coded Framework:**
Each seven-step communication framework step uses a distinct color marker in the opening frame, creating visual categorization that helps with:
- **Memory encoding:** Color + acronym + behavior creates multiple retrieval pathways
- **Progress tracking:** As the animation advances through steps, learners see where they are in the framework
- **Pattern recognition:** Students can mentally map their own situations to specific framework components

**Text Timing & Placement:**
- **"DESCRIBE" title card:** Large, centered text (Scene 03) creates a chapter marker, signaling framework component shift
- **On-screen acronym list:** Persistent visual reference allows learners to connect dialogue back to framework terminology
- **Minimal text during dialogue:** Avoids cognitive overload; focus remains on character modeling

### Accessibility & Inclusive Design Considerations

**Multi-Sensory Learning:**
- **Visual:** Character demonstration, on-screen text, color coding
- **Auditory:** Dialogue modeling tone, pacing, word choice
- **Reading:** Transcript available (implied from provided transcript)
- **Captions:** Ensuring deaf/hard-of-hearing accessibility (standard practice for educational video)

**Cultural Considerations:**
- **Neutral character styling:** Avoids stereotyping while remaining relatable
- **Professional but approachable language:** Student uses formal register without stiffness ("I appreciate you taking the time...")
- **Power balance acknowledgment:** Student shows respect for instructor's authority while maintaining self-advocacy

## Reflections & Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the power of scenario-based learning for soft skills development. Rather than explaining communication techniques abstractly, showing them in action—with realistic dialogue, emotional stakes, and positive outcomes—creates a mental template students can reference when facing similar situations.

**Key Takeaway:** When teaching interpersonal skills, concrete examples beat abstract definitions. Students don't need to memorize the seven-step communication framework acronym as much as they need to see what "describing the situation factually" or "appearing confident" actually looks and sounds like in real conversation. Animation provides that model in a low-stakes, repeatable format that empowers learners to practice and apply.

The visual medium also allowed for dual-channel instruction—characters demonstrate while text reinforces—creating redundancy that supports diverse learning styles and improves retention. This approach could be scaled to other soft skills scenarios (conflict resolution, feedback delivery, boundary setting) using the same narrative + framework structure.
