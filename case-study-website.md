## The Challenge

A cloud-based design collaboration platform was struggling with customer adoption despite strong sales performance. Architecture and interior design firms were purchasing the platform, but **55% of seats remained unused after 30 days**—a critical churn risk that threatened revenue retention and growth.

### The Business Problem

**Symptoms:**
- New customers received login credentials but no structured onboarding
- Teams reverted to familiar tools (email, Dropbox) within weeks
- Support teams overwhelmed with basic "how do I..." tickets
- 25% annual churn rate driven by perceived complexity
- Negative impact on expansion revenue and referrals

**Root Causes (Performance Analysis):**
Using Gilbert's Behavior Engineering Model, I confirmed the gap was primarily a **knowledge problem**, not motivation or environment:
- Users had access to the platform (resources ✓)
- Users wanted to solve collaboration pain points (motivation ✓)
- Users lacked procedural knowledge of workflows (knowledge ✗)

**Business Impact:**
- **$150K ARR at risk** from preventable churn
- **High support costs** (40% of tickets were onboarding-related)
- **Slow time-to-value** (14 days average to first project)

---

## The Solution

I designed a **dual-path customer enablement program** that transformed new customers from purchase to daily usage through role-based, self-paced eLearning delivered in Articulate Rise 360.

### Strategic Approach

**Two Learning Paths for Two Audiences:**

1. **Administrator Path (30 minutes)**
   - Target: IT Managers, Operations Managers
   - Focus: Workspace setup, user management, templates, integrations
   - Outcome: Launch-ready workspace configured in <30 minutes

2. **End User Path (15 minutes)**
   - Target: Designers, Architects (billable time-constrained)
   - Focus: Project creation, file uploads, review cycles, deliverables
   - Outcome: First project completed in <15 minutes

**Why Role-Based Paths?**
- Admins and end users have different tasks, prior knowledge, time availability, and motivations
- Eliminates cognitive overload (learners skip irrelevant content)
- Increases engagement and completion rates

## My Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Strategy (Week 1-2)

**Needs Analysis**
- Conducted learner analysis using adult learning theory (Knowles' Andragogy)
- Performed task analysis to identify critical workflows vs. "nice to have" features
- Analyzed environment constraints (time-constrained professionals, geographic distribution, mobile access needs)

**Learner Personas Developed:**
- **Sarah Chen (Admin):** IT Manager, 8 years experience, fears misconfiguration, needs step-by-step security-conscious guidance
- **Marcus Rodriguez (End User):** Senior Designer, tool-fatigued, billable time pressure, wants fast visual instruction

**Key Insights:**
- Admins had 30-45 minutes max for onboarding (not 2+ hours)
- Designers needed "show, don't tell" instruction (videos, not text manuals)
- Both audiences valued problem-centered learning over feature tours
- Mobile responsiveness was critical (designers work on tablets)

**Assessment Strategy (Backward Design)**

I applied Wiggins & McTighe's backward design methodology:

1. **Defined terminal objectives** (ABCD format, Bloom's taxonomy-aligned):
   - Admin: Configure workspace with branding and org structure (30 min)
   - End User: Create project and complete review cycle (15 min)

2. **Designed performance-based assessments**:
   - Summative: "Launch-Ready Workspace Challenge" (Admin)
   - Summative: "Complete Your First Project Cycle" (End User)
   - Rubrics with 4-point scales (Exemplary → Needs Work)

3. **Built instruction to close the gap** between current state (no knowledge) and desired state (active usage)

---

### Phase 2: Design & Development (Week 2-4)

**Content Architecture**

**Admin Path (5 modules, 30 minutes total):**
1. Workspace Setup Quick Start (8 min)
2. User & Permission Management (8 min)
3. Template Power-Up (7 min)
4. Integration Accelerators (5 min, optional)
5. Summative Performance Task

**End User Path (5 modules, 15 minutes total):**
1. Project Creation Speed Run (5 min)
2. Upload & Organize Files (4 min)
3. Review & Markup Flow (4 min)
4. Export & Share Deliverables (3 min, optional)
5. Summative Performance Task

**Instructional Design Framework**

Applied evidence-based learning principles throughout:

**Adult Learning Theory (Knowles):**
- **Need to Know:** Led with business value ("Save 10 hours/week on email attachments")
- **Self-Direction:** Optional modules, learner-paced progression, skip known content
- **Experience:** Leveraged prior knowledge (Slack admin → platform admin; Dropbox workflows → platform workflows)
- **Problem-Centered:** Organized around tasks ("Create project") not features ("Click this button")
- **Intrinsic Motivation:** Focused on professional reputation and time savings (not certificates or gamification)

**Cognitive Load Theory (Mayer's Multimedia Principles):**
- **Coherence:** Eliminated decorative graphics, music, extraneous content
- **Segmenting:** Broke 30-min path into 2-3 min chunks with pause points
- **Modality:** Used narration + screen recordings (dual-channel processing)
- **Worked Examples:** Showed complete workflows before asking learners to practice
- **Signaling:** Used callouts, cursor highlighting, zoom effects to direct attention

**Rise 360 Block Strategy**

Designed screen-by-screen storyboards specifying:
- **Continue blocks:** Welcome screens, learning objectives, module introductions
- **Lesson blocks:** Concept explanations with professional screenshots
- **Video blocks:** Screen recordings with narration (5-8 min per video)
- **Process blocks:** Step-by-step procedures with numbered instructions
- **Knowledge Check blocks:** Formative assessments every 2-3 minutes (immediate feedback)
- **Scenario blocks:** Branching simulations for decision-making practice (permission assignment, export method selection)
- **Tabs blocks:** Organized related content (comparison charts, troubleshooting guides)

**Video Production**

Created detailed narration scripts for 6 videos:
- **Admin videos (3):** Workspace setup, user management, template creation
- **End user videos (3):** Project creation, file upload, review cycle

**Production specifications:**
- 1920x1080 resolution, 30fps, H.264 codec
- Conversational narration (8-12 words per sentence)
